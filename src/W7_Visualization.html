<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This week, we'll be discussing the power of visualizations for
understanding worldwide trends and for using analytics to stop
crime. In the first lecture, we'll use data from the World Health
Organization to create visualizations that help us understand and
communicate global health trends.
</p>

<p>
We'll discuss the idea of using visualization to better understand
data and to provide insights on the problem we're addressing.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why visualization?</b>
</p>

<p>
People often say that a picture is like a thousand words. In the same
spirit, John Tukey, a major statistician at Princeton, wrote that "the
picture-examining eye is the best finder we have of the wholly
unanticipated."
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-WhyVisualization.png" alt="VIS-WhyVisualization.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Visualization is further useful for initial data exploration, for
interpreting models, and for communicating results effectively.
</p>

<p>
Let us give some examples of different modes of visualization that
illustrate these points. The figure shows the miles per gallon of a
car as a function of the car's weight. The figure clearly illustrates
that as the weight of the car increases, the miles per gallon
decrease.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-InitialExploration.png" alt="VIS-InitialExploration.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The same graph, but now colors of the points signify the number of
cylinders in the car: four for red, six for green, and eight in blue.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-ExploreFurther.png" alt="VIS-ExploreFurther.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the same data, we now plot a regression line that captures the
intuition that as the weight of the car increases, the miles per
gallon decrease.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-RegressionLine.png" alt="VIS-RegressionLine.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In this plot, we'll visualize burglaries in the city of Houston by
combining data and geographical location in a map.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-GeographicalData.png" alt="VIS-GeographicalData.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This plot illustrates, using a heat map, the usage of rented bicycles
from the Hubway company. The horizontal axis is the hour of the day,
and the vertical axis the day of the week, starting on Sunday. The
heat map shows that the usage increases during the morning and night
rush hours on weekdays.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-ShowRelationships.png" alt="VIS-ShowRelationships.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The next plot helps us visualize histograms of different categories
using the Hubway data.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-ExploreCategories.png" alt="VIS-ExploreCategories.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This plot shows US unemployment by state. The lighter colors
corresponding to smaller unemployment, and the darker colors
corresponding to larger unemployment rates.
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
The plan this week is to create all of these visualizations. We'll see
how visualizations can be used to better understand data, communicate
information more effectively, show the results of analytical models.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Normally, a scatterplot only allows us to visualize two dimensions -
one on the x-axis, and one on the y-axis. In the previous video we
were able to show a third dimension on the scatterplot using what
attribute?

The World Health Organization, WHO for short, is the authority for
health within the United Nations system.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-WHO.png" alt="VIS-WHO.png" />
</p>

<p>
WHO communicates information about global health in order to inform
citizens, donors, policymakers, and organizations around the world.

<p>
Their primary publication is <b>World Health Report</b>. Each issue focuses
on a specific aspect of global health, and includes statistics and
experts' assessments.
</p>

<p>
WHO also maintains an open, online repository of global health
data. WHO provides some data visualizations, which helps them
communicate more effectively with the public. As an example, the graph
shows the World Energy Consumption during 2001 to 2003.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Video 3: What is Data Visualization?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
We will discuss the meaning of data visualization, and why it's often
useful to visualize your data to discover hidden trends and
properties.
</p>

<p>
Data visualization is defined as a mapping of data properties to
visual properties.
</p>

<p>
Data properties are usually numerical or categorical, like the mean of
a variable, the maximum value of a variable, or the number of
observations with a certain property.
</p>

<p>
Visual properties can be \((x,y)\) coordinates to plot points on a
graph, colors to assign labels, sizes, shapes, heights, etc. Both
types of properties are used to better understand the data, but in
different ways.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-WhatsIsDataVisualization.png" alt="VIS-WhatsIsDataVisualization.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
To motivate the need for data visualization, let's look at a famous
example called Anscombe's Quartet. Each of these tables corresponds to
a different data set. We have four data sets, each with two variables,
\(x\) and \(y\).
</p>

<p>
Just looking at the tables of data, it's hard to notice anything
special about it. It turns out that the mean and variance of the \(x\)
variable is the same for all four data sets, the mean and variance of
the \(y\) variable is the same for all four data sets, and the correlation
between \(x\) and \(y\), as well as the regression equation to predict \(y\) from
\(x\), is the exact same for all four data sets.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-AnscombeQ.png" alt="VIS-AnscombeQ.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So just by looking at data properties, we might conclude that these
data sets are very similar. But if we plot the four data sets, they're
very different.
</p>

<p>
These plots show the four data sets, with the x variable on the
x-axis, and the y variable on the y-axis. Visually, these data sets
look very different. But without visualizing them, we might not have
noticed this.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-AnscombeQ02.png" alt="VIS-AnscombeQ02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is one example of why visualizing data can be very important.
</p>

<p>
We'll use the <b>ggplot2</b> package in R to create data visualizations. This
package was created by Hadley Wickham, who described ggplot as "a
plotting system for R based on the grammar of graphics, which tries to
take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and none of the bad
parts.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-ggplot.png" alt="VIS-ggplot.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So what do we gain from using ggplot over just making plots using the
basic R functions, or what's referred to as base R?
</p>

<p>
Well, in base R, each mapping of data properties to visual properties
is its own special case. When we create a scatter plot, or a box plot,
or a histogram, we have to use a completely different function.
</p>

<p>
It's challenging to create any sophisticated visualizations. It's also
difficult to add elements to existing plots.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BaseVSggplot.png" alt="VIS-BaseVSggplot.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But in ggplot, the mapping of data properties to visual properties is
done by just adding layers to the plot. This makes it much easier to
create sophisticated plots and to add to existing plots.
</p>

<p>
So what is the grammar of graphics that ggplot is based on? All ggplot
graphics consist of three elements. The first is data, in a data
frame. The second is an aesthetic mapping, which describes how
variables in the data frame are mapped to graphical attributes.
</p>

<p>
This is where we'll define which variables are on the x- and y-axes,
whether or not points should be colored or shaped by certain
attributes, etc.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-GrammarOfGraphics.png" alt="VIS-GrammarOfGraphics.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The third element is which geometric objects we want to determine how
the data values are rendered graphically. This is where we indicate if
the plot should have points, lines, bars, boxes, etc.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">

In this quick question, we'll be asking you questions about the
following three plots, that we saw in Video 1. We'll refer to them as
the "Scatterplot", the "Histogram", and the "US Map".

<p>
We can see that we have 194 observations, or countries, and 13
different variables&#x2013; the name of the country, the region the
country's in, the population in thousands, the percentage of the
population under 15 or over 60, the fertility rate or average number
of children per woman, the life expectancy in years, the child
mortality rate, which is the number of children who die by age five
per 1,000 births, the number of cellular subscribers per 100
population, the literacy rate among adults older than 15, the gross
national income per capita, the percentage of male children enrolled
in primary school, and the percentage of female children enrolled in
primary school.
</p>

<p>
In week one, the very first plot we made in R was a scatterplot of
fertility rate versus gross national income. Let's make this plot
again, just like we did in week one.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOw1Plot" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOw1Plot.png" alt="WHOw1Plot.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 23:</span> WHO plot from week 1</p>
</div>

<p>
This plot shows us that a higher fertility rate is correlated with a
lower income. Now, let's redo this scatter plot, but this time using
ggplot.
</p>

<p>
We'll see how ggplot can be used to make more visually
appealing and complex scatter plots.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Install new package: ggplot2 ..."</span>)

</div>

<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
Now, remember we need at least three things to create a plot using
ggplot&#x2013; data, an aesthetic mapping of variables in the data frame to
visual output, and a geometric object. So first, let's create the
ggplot object with the data and the aesthetic mapping.
</p>

<p>
We'll save it to the variable scatter plot, and then use the ggplot
function, where the first argument is the name of our data set, WHO,
which specifies the data to use, and the second argument is the
aesthetic mapping, <code>aes</code>.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOggplotExample" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOggplotExample.png" alt="WHOggplotExample.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 24:</span> WHO scatter plot with ggplot</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, we need to tell ggplot what geometric objects to put in the
plot. We could use bars, lines, points, or something else. This is a
big difference between ggplot and regular plotting in R. You can build
different types of graphs by using the same ggplot object.
</p>

<p>
There's no need to learn one function for bar graphs, a completely
different function for line graphs, etc. So first, let's just create a
straightforward scatter plot. So the geometry we want to add is
points. We can do this by typing the name of our ggplot object,
scatter plot, and then adding the function, geom_point().
</p>

<p>
You should see a new plot in the Graphics window that looks similar to
our original plot, but there are already a few nice improvements. One
is that we don't have the data set name with a dollar  sign in front
of the label on each axis, just the variable name.
</p>

<p>
Another is that we have these nice grid lines in the background and
solid points that pop out from the background.
</p>

<p>
We could have made a line graph just as easily by changing point to
line.
</p>

<p>
In addition to specifying that the geometry we want is points, we can
add other options, like the color, shape, and size of the
points. Let's redo our plot with blue triangles instead of circles. In
the empty parentheses for <code>geom_point</code>, we're going to specify some
properties of the points.
</p>

<p>
<code>scatterplot + geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3, shape = 17)</code>
</p>

<p>
Change <code>blue</code> to <code>darkred</code>, and change shape to 8. Now, you should see
dark red stars. There are many different colors and shapes that you
can specify. We've provided some information in the text below this
video.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's save our plot to a file. We can do this by first saving our
plot to a variable.
</p>

<p>
<code>fertilityGNIplot = scatterplot +</code>
<code>geom_point(colour = "blue", size = 3, shape = 17) +
~ggtitle("Fertility Rate vs. Gross National Income")</code>
</p>

<p>
This will save our scatter plot to the variable,
<code>fertilityGNIplot</code>. Now, let's create a file we want to save our plot
to. We can do that with the <code>pdf</code> function.
</p>

<p>
<code>pdf("MyPlot.pdf")</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>print(fertilityGNIplot)</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>dev.off()</code>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">
<p>
Now, let's color the points by region instead. This time, we want to
add a color option to our aesthetic, since we're assigning a variable
in our data set to the colors.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHObyRegion" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHObyRegion.png" alt="WHObyRegion.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 26:</span> Scatter plot of WHO by region</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, in our plot, we should see that each point is colored
corresponding to the region that country belongs in. So the countries
in Africa are colored red, the countries in the Americas are colored
gold, the countries in the Eastern Mediterranean are colored green,
etc.
</p>

<p>
This really helps us see something that we didn't see before. The
points from the different regions are really located in different
areas on the plot. Let's now instead color the points according to the
country's life expectancy.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOscatterPlotLifeExpectancy" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOscatterPlotLifeExpectancy.png" alt="WHOscatterPlotLifeExpectancy.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 27:</span> Who scatter plot by life expectancy</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, we should see that each point is colored according to the life
expectancy in that country. Notice that before, we were coloring by a
factor variable, Region.
</p>

<p>
So we had exactly seven different colors corresponding to the seven
different regions. Here, we're coloring by LifeExpectancy instead,
which is a numerical variable, so we get a gradient of colors, like
this.
</p>

<p>
Lighter blue corresponds to a higher life expectancy, and darker blue
corresponds to a lower life expectancy.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we were interested in seeing whether the fertility rate of a
country was a good predictor of the percentage of the population
under 15. Intuitively, we would expect these variables to be highly
correlated. But before trying any statistical models, let's explore
our data with a plot.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOFertilityRateVSPopUnder15" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOFertilityRateVSPopUnder15.png" alt="WHOFertilityRateVSPopUnder15.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 28:</span> WHO fertility rate vs. population under 15</p>
</div>

<p>
This is really interesting. It looks like the variables are certainly
correlated, but as the fertility rate increases, the variable,
<code>Under15</code> starts increasing less.
</p>

<p>
So this doesn't really look like a linear relationship. But we suspect
that a log transformation of <code>FertilityRate</code> will be better. Let's
give it a shot.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOlogFertilityRateVSUnder15" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOlogFertilityRateVSUnder15.png" alt="WHOlogFertilityRateVSUnder15.png" />

<p>
Let's try building in a simple linear regression model to predict the
percentage of the population under 15, using the log of the fertility
rate.

<p>
Let's look at the summary of our model. It looks like the log of
<code>FertilityRate</code> is indeed a great predictor of <code>Under15</code>. The variable
is highly significant, and our <code>R-squared</code> is \(0.9391\).

Visualization was a great way for us to realize that the log
transformation would be better. If we instead had just used the
<code>FertilityRate</code>, the R-squared would have been \(0.87\). That's a pretty
significant decrease in <code>R-squared</code>.
</p>

<p>
So now, let's add this regression line to our plot. This is pretty
easy in ggplot. We just have to add another layer.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOfetilityRvsUnder15LRmodel" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 30:</span> WHO scatter plot of the fertility rate vs. under 15 with a linear regression model</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, you should see a blue line going through the data. This is our
regression line. By default, ggplot will draw a \(95\%\) confidence
interval shaded around the line.
</p>

<p>
We can change this by specifying options within the statistics layer.
</p>

<p>
This will give a \(99\%\) confidence interval.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOFertilityRatevsUnder15LM99" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 31:</span> WHO scatter plot of fertility rate vs under 15 with regression model with 99%</p>
</div>

<p>
We could instead take away the confidence interval altogether by
deleting
</p>

<p>
<code>level = 0.99</code>
</p>

<p>
and typing
</p>

<p>
<code>se = FALSE</code>
</p>

<p>
Now, we just have the regression line in blue.
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOFertilityRVsUnder15WlmOnly" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOFertilityRVsUnder15WlmOnly.png" alt="WHOFertilityRVsUnder15WlmOnly.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 32:</span> WHO Fertility rate vs. Under 15 with LM only</p>
</div>

<p>
We could also change the color of the regression line
by typing as an option
</p>

<p>
~color = "orange"~
</p>


<div id="fig:WHOFerRateVsUnder15WlmOrange" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/WHOFerRateVsUnder15WlmOrange.png" alt="WHOFerRateVsUnder15WlmOrange.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 33:</span> WHO Fertility rate vs Under 15 with regression model in orange</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, we have an orange linear regression line. As we've seen in this
lecture, scatter plots are great for exploring data. However, there
are many other ways to represent data visually, such as box plots,
line charts, histograms, heat maps, and geographic maps.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, it may be better to choose one of these other ways of
visualizing your data.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, ggplot makes it easy to go from one type of visualization to
another, simply by adding the appropriate layer to the plot.
</p>

<p>
<b>So what is the edge of visualizations?</b>
</p>

<p>
The WHO data that we used here is used by citizens, policymakers, and
organizations around the world.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-TAE.png" alt="VIS-TAE.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Visualizing the data facilitates the understanding of global health
trends at a glance.
</p>

<p>
By using ggplot in R, we're able to visualize data for exploration,
modeling, and sharing analytics results.

We will discuss how visualization can offer insights in the area of
policing in urban environments.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP.png" alt="AP.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The explosion of computerized data affects all parts of society,
including policing. In the past, human judgment and experience was the
only tool in identifying patterns in criminal behavior.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-AnalyticalPoliceman.png" alt="AP-AnalyticalPoliceman.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Los Angeles police worked for months to catch Manson and his
followers. These days the LAPD is on an offensive to prevent
crime. Its latest weapon is a computer program that can actually
predict where crimes will happen.
</p>

<p>
And justice correspondent Bob Orr has a first look at the results. In
the Foothill Division north of downtown Los Angeles, police are
patrolling the largely working-class neighborhoods with specially
marked maps. The small red squares are hot spots, where computers
project property crimes are most likely.
</p>

<p>
It's called predictive policing. A program which Captain Sean
Malinowski says puts officers on the scene before crimes occur. 65% of
our crimes are burglary, grand theft auto, and burglary for motor
vehicle. And that's what these boxes represent. That's a pretty small
box, 500 feet by 500 feet. Yes, it is a small area.
</p>

<p>
These crime prediction boxes come from the same kind of mathematical
calculation used to predict earthquakes and aftershocks.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-PredictivePolicing.png" alt="AP-PredictivePolicing.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
By analyzing the times, dates, and places of recent crimes computers
project hot spots for burglaries, break-ins, and car thefts. LA's
Police Chief Charlie Beck says increasing police patrols inside those
boxes denies criminals opportunity. The real measure of this is not
how many people you catch, it's how much crime you prevent.
</p>

<p>
I love catching people. It's what I live for. But, what I'd rather do
is live in a place and work in a place where crime didn't happen.
</p>

<p>
Chief Beck, a 35-year veteran and the father of two LAPD officers, has
faced some skepticism in selling the predictive concept.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're a street cop. -
</li>

<li>I am. -
</li>

<li>So somebody comes to you with a computer program that says, here
we're going to predict the future, we're going to tell you where
crime is going to occur.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Aren't some of the guys on the street just going to roll their eyes
and say, oh come on?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Well, of course.
</li>

<li>I mean, that's the nature of human beings.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I mean everybody thinks that they do their profession as well as it
can be done already, so they don't need any help.
</p>

<p>
If this old street cop can change the way that he thinks about this
stuff, then I know that my kids can do the same.
</p>

<p>
The LAPD began testing the predictive policing model here in the
Foothill Division in November, and the early results are encouraging.
</p>

<p>
The LAPD began testing the predictive policing model here in the
Foothill Division in November, and the early results are
encouraging. Burglaries are down 33%, and violent crime is also down
21%.
</p>

<p>
That success will allow Beck to expand the program to other parts of
the city and leverage limited resources.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm not going to get more money. I'm not going to get more cops. But
I have to be better at using what I have, and that's what predictive
policing is about.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's also about driving the crime rate lower. Crime here has dropped
nine straight years. With these small red boxes, LA is aiming
for 10. Bob Orr, CBS News, Los Angeles. (End TV report).
</p>

<p>
The Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck writes, "I'm not going to
get more money. I'm not going to get more cops.

<p>
Let me comment on the role of analytics. The analytical tools you have
learned in this class can be used to make these predictive policing
models possible.
</p>

<p>
However, communicating the results of these models is critical. A
linear regression output table will not be of use to a police person
on patrol. Visualization bridges the gap between the analytics and the
end user.

</p>

<p>
According the the Los Angeles Police Department, predictive policing
does not eliminate the need for police officers or increase the rate
at which they catch criminals. It does, however, allow more
intelligent officer deployment, prevents crime, and helps them use
resources more effectively.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
We will discuss how we can create visualizations that are used in
predictive policing models. In almost every application, before we
even consider a predictive model, we should try to understand the
historical data.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-UnderstandingThePast.png" alt="AP-UnderstandingThePast.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We will use data from the city of Chicago, in the United States, about
motor vehicle thefts.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-CrimeOverTime.png" alt="AP-CrimeOverTime.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Given this data on crimes, suppose we wanted to communicate crime
patterns over the course of an average week. We could display daily
crime averages using a line graph, like the one shown here, but this
doesn't seem too useful.
</p>

<p>
We can see that crime tends to be higher on Saturday, but when on
Saturday, and where?
</p>

<p>
We could replace our x-axis with the hour of the day and have a
different line for every day of the week to understand when crime
occurs in more detail. But this would be a jumbled mess with seven
lines, and probably very hard to read.
</p>

<p>
We could instead use no visualization at all, and instead present
information in a table, like the one shown here. For each hour and
day, we have the total number of crimes that occurred. This is a valid
representation of the data, but large tables of numbers can be hard to
read and understand.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-CrimeOverTime02.png" alt="AP-CrimeOverTime02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>So how can we make the table more interesting and usable?</b> A great
way to visualize information in a two-dimensional table is with a heat
map.
</p>

<p>
Heat maps visualize data using three attributes. Two of the attributes
are on the x and y-axes, typically displayed horizontally and
vertically.
</p>

<p>
The third attribute is represented by shades of color. In this
example, lower values in the third attribute correspond to colors
closer to blue, and higher values in the third attribute correspond to
colors closer to red.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-Heatmaps.png" alt="AP-Heatmaps.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
For example, the x-axis could be hours of the day, the y-axis could be
days of the week, and the colors could correspond to the amount of
crime.
</p>

<p>
In a heat map, we can pick different color schemes based on the type
of data to convey different messages.
</p>

<p>
In crime, a yellow to red color scheme might be appropriate because it
can highlight some of the more dangerous areas in red. Your eye is
naturally drawn to the red areas of the plot.
</p>

<p>
In other applications, both high and low values are meaningful, so
having a more varied color scheme might be useful.
</p>

<p>
And in other applications, you might only want to see cells with high
values, so you could use a gray scale to make the cells with low
values white.
</p>

<p>
The x and y-axes in a heat map don't need to be continuous. In our
example, we have a categorical or factor variable &#x2013; the day of the
week. And we can even combine a heat map with a geographical map,
which we'll discuss later in this lecture.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-Heatmaps02.png" alt="AP-Heatmaps02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This type of heat map is frequently used in predictive policing to
show crime hot spots in a city. In this lecture, we'll use Chicago
motor vehicle theft data to explore patterns of crime, both over days
of the week, and over hours of the day.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AP-AChicagoCrimeHeatmap.png" alt="AP-AChicagoCrimeHeatmap.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We are interested in analyzing the total number of car thefts that
occur in any particular hour of a day of the week over our whole data
set.

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
A heatmap would be useful for the middle two options, because they are
trying to visualize crime counts relative to two variables. For the
first option, you could use a basic scatterplot with time on the
x-axis and amount of crime on the y-axis. For the last option, you
could use a bar plot with a bar for each month and the height being
the average amount of crime in that month.

In this format, we can extract the hour and the day of the week from

Let's take a look at the structure of our data again to see what it
looks like.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Revising the structure of the dataframe mvt:"</span>)
str(mvt)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Revising the structure of the dataframe mvt:
'data.frame':   191641 obs. of  5 variables:

 $ Hour     : int  23 22 22 22 21 20 20 20 19 18 ...
</pre>

<p>
Now, we have two more variables&#x2013; Weekday, which gives the day of the
week, and Hour, which gives the hour of the day. Now, we're ready to
make some line plots. Let's start by creating the line plot we saw in
the previous video with just one line and a value  for every day of
the week.
</p>

<p>
We want to plot as that value the total number of crimes on each day
of the week.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Need the total number of crimes on each day of the week:"</span>)
sort(table(mvt$Weekday), decreasing = <span style="color: #3cb371;">TRUE</span>)

</div>

<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
This gives the total amount of crime on each day of the week. Let's
save this table as a data frame so that we can pass it to ggplot as
our data.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Save this table as a data frame:"</span>)

str(WeekdayCounts)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Save this table as a data frame:
'data.frame':   7 obs. of  2 variables:

 $ Freq: int  29284 27397 27118 26316 27319 26791 27416
</pre>

<p>
We can see that our data frame has seven observations, one for each
day of the week, and two different variables.  The first variable,
called Var1, gives the name of the day of the week, and the second
variable, called Freq, for frequency, gives the total amount of crime
on that day of the week.
</p>

<p>
Now, we're ready to make our plot. First, we need to load the ggplot2
package.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTCrimePlot01" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 47:</span> MVT Chicago crime plot</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, we just need to add <code>geom_line(aes(group=1))</code>. This just groups
all of our data into one line, since we want one line in our plot.
</p>

<p>
We can see that this is very close to the plot we want. We have the
total number of crime plotted by day of the week, but our days of the
week are a little bit out of order. We have Friday first, then Monday,
then Saturday, then Sunday, etc.
</p>

<p>
What <code>ggplot</code> did was it put the days of the week in alphabetical
order. But we actually want the days of the week in chronological
order to make this plot a bit easier to read. We can do this by making
the <code>Var1</code> variable an ordered factor variable.
</p>

<p>
This signals to ggplot that the ordering is meaningful. We can do this
by using the factor function.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTCrimeplot02" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 48:</span> MVT Chicago crime plot v2</p>
</div>

<p>
We have the total crime by day of the week with the days of the week
in chronological order. The last thing we'll want to do to our plot is
just change the x- and y-axis labels, since they're not very helpful
as they are now.
</p>

The linetype parameter makes the line dashed, and the alpha parameter
makes the line lighter in color, or more transparent. The two plots
can be generated with the following commands:
</p>

<p>
<code>ggplot(WeekdayCounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +</code>
<code>geom_line(aes(group=1), linetype=2) + xlab("Day of the Week") +</code>
<code>ylab("Total Motor Vehicle Thefts")</code>
</p>

<code>ggplot(WeekdayCounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +</code>
<code>geom_line(aes(group=1), alpha=0.3) + xlab("Day of the Week") +</code>

<p>
This table gives, for each day of the week and each hour, the total
number of motor vehicle thefts that occurred. For example, on Friday
at 4 AM, there were 473 motor vehicle thefts, whereas on Saturday at
midnight, there were 2,050 motor vehicle thefts. Let's save this table
to a data frame so that we can use it in our visualizations.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Save this to a data frame:"</span>)
DayHourCounts <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> as.data.frame(table(mvt$Weekday, mvt$Hour))
str(DayHourCounts)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Save this to a data frame:
'data.frame':   168 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ Var1: Factor w/ 7 levels "Friday","Monday",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 ...
 $ Var2: Factor w/ 24 levels "0","1","2","3",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ...
 $ Freq: int  1873 1900 2050 2028 1856 1691 1814 932 825 1267 ...
</pre>

<p>
Let's take a look at the structure of the data frame we just
created. We can see that we have 168 observations&#x2013; one for each day
of the week and hour pair, and three different variables.
</p>

<p>
The first variable, <code>Var1, gives the day of the week. The second
variable, ~Var2</code>, gives the hour of the day. And the third variable,
<code>Freq</code> for frequency, gives the total crime count.
</p>

<p>
Let's convert the second variable, <code>Var2</code>, to actual numbers and call
it <code>Hour</code>, since this is the hour of the day, and it makes sense that
it's numerical.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Convert the second variable, Var2, to numbers and call it Hour..."</span>)

</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Convert the second variable, Var2, to numbers and call it Hour...
</pre>

<p>
This is how we convert a factor variable to a numeric variable. Now
we're ready to create our plot. We just need to change the group to
<code>Var1</code>, which is the day of the week.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTHeatCrimePlot01" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MVTHeatCrimePlot01.png" alt="MVTHeatCrimePlot01.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 52:</span> MVT Chicago heat plot v1</p>
</div>

<p>
You should see a new plot show up in the graphics window. It has seven
lines, one for each day of the week. While this is interesting, we
can't tell which line is which day, so let's change the colors of the
lines to correspond to the days of the week.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTHeatCrimePlot02" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MVTHeatCrimePlot02.png" alt="MVTHeatCrimePlot02.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 53:</span> MVT heat crime plot v2</p>
</div>

<p>
Now in our plot, each line is colored corresponding to the day of the
week. This helps us see that on Saturday and Sunday, for example, the
green and the teal lines, there's less motor vehicle thefts in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
Working a little with the plot:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 54:</span> MVT heat plot previous v3</p>

<p>
This configuration is little hard to read too, we can try again and
see if is possible to improve the visualization.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVtHeatCrimePlot04" class="figure">

</div>

<p>
While we can get some information from this plot, it's still quite
hard to interpret. Seven lines is a lot.
</p>

<p>
Let's instead visualize the same information with a heat map. To make
a heat map, we'll use our data in our data frame
<code>DayHourCounts</code>. First, though, we need to fix the order of the days
so that they'll show up in chronological order instead of in
alphabetical order.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Fix the order of the days..."</span>)
DayHourCounts$Var1 <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> factor(DayHourCounts$Var1, ordered = <span style="color: #3cb371;">TRUE</span>,
                             levels = c(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Monday"</span>, <span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Tuesday"</span>,
                                        <span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Wednesday"</span>, <span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Thursday"</span>,

                                        <span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Sunday"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Fix the order of the days...
</pre>

<p>
Now let's make our heat map. In the aesthetic for our tiles, we want
the fill to be equal to <code>Freq</code>. This will define the colors of the
rectangles in our heat map to correspond to the total crime.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTHeatCrimeMapR1" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MVTHeatCrimeMapR1.png" alt="MVTHeatCrimeMapR1.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 56:</span> New MVT heat Chicago crime plot v1</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>So how do we read this?</b> For each hour and each day of the week, we
have a rectangle in our heat map. The color of that rectangle
indicates the frequency, or the number of crimes that occur in that
hour and on that day.
</p>

<p>
Our legend tells us that lighter colors correspond to more crime. So
we can see that a lot of crime happens around midnight, particularly
on the weekends.
</p>

<p>
We can change the label on the legend, and get rid of the y label to
make our plot a little nicer.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTHeatCrimeMapR2" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MVTHeatCrimeMapR2.png" alt="MVTHeatCrimeMapR2.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 57:</span> MVT Chicago's heat crime plot v2</p>

<p>
We can also change the color scheme.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTHeatCrimeMapR3" class="figure">

<p>
This is a common color scheme in policing. It shows the hot spots, or
the places with more crime, in red. So now the most crime is shown by
the red spots and the least crime is shown by the lighter areas.
</p>

<p>
It looks like Friday night is a pretty common time for motor vehicle
thefts. We saw something that we didn't really see in the heat map
before.
</p>

<p>
It's often useful to change the color scheme depending on whether you
want high values or low values to pop out, and the feeling you want
the plot to portray.

To get Plot (2), we changed the arguments "x" and "y" (we flipped
them). Plot (2) can be generated with the following code:
</p>

<p>
<code>ggplot(DayHourCounts, aes(x = Var1, y = Hour)) +</code>
<code>geom_tile(aes(fill=Freq)) + scale_fill_gradient(name="Total MV</code>
<code>Thefts", low="white", high="red") +</code>
<code>theme(axis.title.y=element_blank())</code>

<p>
You should see a geographical map of the city of Chicago. Now let's
plot the first 100 motor vehicle thefts in our data set on this map.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTChicagoMap02" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MVTChicagoMap02.png" alt="MVTChicagoMap02.png" />

<p>
You should see the map of Chicago with black points marking where the
first 100 motor vehicle thefts were. If we plotted all 190,000 motor
vehicle thefts, we would just see a big black box, which wouldn't be
helpful at all.
</p>

<p>
We're more interested in whether or not an area has a high amount of
crime, so let's round our latitude and longitude to two digits of
accuracy and create a crime counts data frame for each area.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Round our latitude and longitude to 2 digits of accuracy,\nand create a crime counts data frame for each area:"</span>)

                                    round(mvt$Latitude, 2)))
str(LatLonCounts)

<pre class="example">

 $ Freq: int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
</pre>

<p>
This gives us the total crimes at every point on a grid. Let's take a
look at our data frame using the <code>str</code> function. We have 1,638
observations and three variables.
</p>

<p>
The first two variables, <code>Var1</code> and <code>Var2</code>, are the latitude and
longitude coordinates, and the third variable is the number of motor
vehicle thefts that occur in that area.
</p>

<p>
Let's convert our longitude and latitude variables to numbers and call
them <code>Lat</code> and <code>Long</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Convert our Longitude and Latitude variable to numbers..."</span>)

</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Convert our Longitude and Latitude variable to numbers...
</pre>

<p>
Now, let's plot these points on our map, making the size and color of
the points depend on the total number of motor vehicle thefts.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTChicagoMap03" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 66:</span> MVT Chicago's crime map v3</p>

<p>
So we can see that the lighter and larger points correspond to more
motor vehicle thefts. This helps us see where in Chicago more crimes
occur. If we want to change the color scheme,

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 67:</span> MVT Chicago's crime map v4</p>
</div>

<p>
you should see the same plot as before, but this time, the areas with
more crime are closer to red and the areas with less crime are closer
to yellow.
</p>

<p>
We can also use geom_tile to make something that looks more like a
traditional heat map.
</p>


<div id="fig:MVTChicagoMap05" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 68:</span> MVT Chicago's crime map v5</p>
</div>

<p>
We have <code>alpha=Freq</code>. This will define how to scale the colors on the
heat map according to the crime counts.
</p>

<p>
We've created a geographical heat map, which in our case shows a
visualization of the data, but it could also show the predictions of a
model. Now that our heat map is loaded, let's take a look.
</p>

<p>
In each area of Chicago, now that area is colored in red by the amount
of crime there. This looks more like a map that people use for
predictive policing.

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
You can take a subset of LatLonCounts, only keeping the observations
for which <code>Freq &gt; 0</code> with the following command:
</p>

<p>
<code>LatLonCounts2 = subset(LatLonCounts, Freq &gt; 0)</code>
</p>

<p>
Then, you can generate the new heatmap with the following command:
</p>

<p>
<code>ggmap(chicago) +</code>
<code>geom_tile(data=LatLonCounts2, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, alpha=Freq), fill="red")</code>
4
The number of observations in <code>LatLonCounts2</code> is $686, and the number of
observations in <code>LatLonCounts</code> is \(1638\). These numbers can be found by
using <code>nrow</code> or <code>str</code>.

<p>
Let's take a look at the structure of this data using the <code>str</code>
function. We have 51 observations for the 50 states plus Washington,
DC, and six different variables:
</p>

<p>
The name of the state, the population, the population density, the
number of murders, the number of murders that used guns, and the rate
of gun ownership.
</p>

<p>
A map of the United States is included in R. Let's load the map and
call it <code>statesMap</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Load the map of the US..."</span>)

 $ region   : chr  "alabama" "alabama" "alabama" "alabama" ...
 $ subregion: chr  NA NA NA NA ...
</pre>

<p>
Let's see what this looks like by typing in <code>str(statesMap)</code>. This is
just a data frame summarizing how to draw the United States. To plot
the map, we'll use the polygons geometry of <code>ggplot</code>.
</p>


<div id="fig:USMurderMap01" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 70:</span> US murder map v1</p>
</div>

<p>
Now in your R graphics window, you should see a map of the United
States. Before we can plot our data on this map, we need to make sure
that the state names are the same in the <code>murders</code> data frame and in the
<code>statesMap</code> data frame.
</p>

<p>
In the <code>murders</code> data frame, our state names are in the <code>State</code> variable,
and they start with a capital letter. But in the <code>statesMap</code> data frame,
our state names are in the <code>region</code> variable, and they're all
lowercase.
</p>

<p>
So let's create a new variable called <code>region</code> in our <code>murders</code> data
frame to match the state name variable in the <code>statesMap</code> data
frame. So we'll add to our murders data frame the variable <code>region</code>,
which will be equal to the lowercase version&#x2013; using the <code>tolower</code>
function that we used in the text analytics lectures.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Create a new variable called region with the\nlowercase names to match the statesMap..."</span>)

</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Create a new variable called region with the

</pre>

<p>
This will just convert the <code>State</code> variable to all lowercase letters
and store it as a new variable called <code>region</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now we can join the <code>statesMap</code> data frame with the <code>murders</code> data
frame by using the <code>merge</code> function, which matches rows of a data
frame based on a shared identifier.
</p>

<p>
We just defined the variable <code>region</code>, which exists in both data
frames.

</pre>

<p>
We have the same number of observations here that we had in the
<code>statesMap</code> data frame, but now we have both the variables from the
<code>statesMap</code> data frame and the variables from the <code>murders</code> data
frame, which were matched up based on the region variable.
</p>

<p>
So now, let's plot the number of murders on our map of the United
States.
</p>


<div id="fig:USMurderMap02" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/USMurderMap02.png" alt="USMurderMap02.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 71:</span> US murder map v2</p>
</div>

<p>
Look at your graphics window now, you should see that each of the
states is colored by the number of murders in that state. States with
a larger number of murders are more red. So it looks like California
and Texas have the largest number of murders.
</p>

<p>
But <b>is that just because they're the most populous states?</b> Let's
create a map of the population of each state to check.
</p>


<div id="fig:USPopulationMapv1" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/USPopulationMapv1.png" alt="USPopulationMapv1.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 72:</span> US population map v1</p>
</div>

<p>
We have a population map here which looks exactly the same as our
murders map. So we need to plot the murder rate instead of the number
of murders to make sure we're not just plotting a population map.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Create a new variable that is the number of murders per\n\t100,000 population..."</span>)
murderMap$MurderRate <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> murderMap$Murders / murderMap$Population * 100000
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Create a new variable that is the number of murders per
       100,000 population...
</pre>

<p>
So we've created a new variable that's the number of murders per
100,000 population.
</p>

<p>
Now let's redo our plot with the fill equal to <code>MurderRate</code>.
</p>


<div id="fig:USMurderMap03" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/USMurderMap03.png" alt="USMurderMap03.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 73:</span> US murder map v3</p>
</div>

<p>
If you look at your graphics window now, you should see that the plot
is surprisingly maroon-looking. There aren't really any red states.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why?</b>
</p>

<p>
It turns out that Washington, DC is an outlier with a very high murder
rate, but it's such a small region on the map that we can't even see
it.
</p>

<p>
So let's redo our plot, removing any observations with murder rates
above 10, which we know will only exclude Washington, DC. Keep in mind
that when interpreting and explaining the resulting plot, you should
always note what you did to create it: removed Washington, DC from the
data.
</p>


<div id="fig:USMurderMap03" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 74:</span> US murder map v3 (Removing Washington DC.)</p>
</div>

<p>
Now if you look back at your graphics window, you can see a range of
colors on the map. In this video, we saw how we can make a heat map on
a map of the United States, which is very useful for organizations
like the World Health Organization or government entities who want to
show data to the public organized by state or country.

<p>
With great power comes great responsibility. There are many ways to
visualize the same data. You have just seen how to make quite
attractive visualizations with ggplot2, which has good default
settings, but judgment is still required from the user.
</p>

<p>
For example, do I decide to vary the size of a point or do I vary the
color of a point?
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting at this point that Excel and other similar programs
can also be used to make perfectly acceptable visualizations, or
terrible ones. The tool can help, but it's ultimately up to the user
to make decisions.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-GreatPower.png" alt="VIS-GreatPower.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So what is the difference between a good visualization and a bad
visualization then?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-Difference.png" alt="VIS-Difference.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I would argue that a good visualization clearly and accurately conveys
the key messages in the data. A bad visualization will obfuscate the
data either through ignorance or malice.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-WhatDoesThisMean.png" alt="VIS-WhatDoesThisMean.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So today, we will look at a few examples of visualizations taken from
a variety of sources. We'll discuss what is good and what is bad about
them. Then we will switch into R to build better versions of them for
ourselves.
</p>


<div class="figure">

<p>
But I want you to think for yourself in this recitation. You might not
agree with all the points I make or my opinions about these
visualizations. Visualization is inherently subjective and the right
visualization will depend on the situation.
</p>

<p>
So use your own judgment and think about what I talked about before
with a good visualization and a bad visualization.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Video 2: Pie Charts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
There are a lot of visualizations in the world and we don't have time
for them all. So let's focus on one particularly abused plot type, the
pie chart.
</p>

<p>
We have a specimen right here. This is a pie chart of phone
application crashes, showing what percentage of all crashes took place
in each mobile operating system. This data set contains information
for all versions of Apple's iOS, which is used in the iPhone, as well
as the various versions of Google's Android.
</p>

<p>
There are many things wrong with this plot, but let's break down
exactly what.
</p>

<p>
Putting aside, for a moment, that there are far too many labels, check
out the ordering of the labels corresponding to iOS. Two sensible ways
of ordering iOS data might be by decreasing percentage or by version
number.
</p>

<p>
Instead, we start at the top with iOS 3.13, with 0%, and then jump to
iOS 4.2.10, with 12.64%, before going back down to iOS 3.2, with 0.00%
again. Which brings us to the number of labels. Many of the segments
are so narrow that they can't be seen, although technically, all data
is retained, because every segment is labeled.
</p>

<p>
If we look at iOS, we see that there are only three major versions, 3,
4, and 5, suggesting we can compress down the iOS segments to just
three segments, while retaining most of the information. At the least,
the versions that differ in the third number should be combined, and
all data points of 0% should be removed.
</p>

<p>
The more fundamental concern of this visualization is that it might
really be showing the percentage of the phone market using each
operating system, and says nothing about whether one operating system
crashes more than the other, which is the focus of this
visualization.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BadVis.png" alt="VIS-BadVis.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Our next pie chart has its own share of problems. This is a plot of
how many shark attacks have been attributed to each type of
shark. Firstly, the pie chart is, for some reason, plotted on a
hemisphere, a graphical effect that adds nothing, but has the effect
of vertically compressing the pie chart.
</p>

<p>
Next, there is the issue of label orientation. While the caption,
"Shark species (total/deaths)", and the label, "White shark", are
horizontal, the rest are vertical and hard to read.
</p>

<p>
They are in order, however, which does help. Although the "Others"
segment is unfortunately large, which is unclear if it is due to there
being a lot of attacks by many species, or if the species is not known
for many attacks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, at a glance, it is hard to distinguish the magnitude of
differences between the orange, green, blue, and brown segments in the
top part of the pie chart, and we must resort to the labels to
distinguish between them. There is no meaning in the colors, they are
arbitrary.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BadVis02.png" alt="VIS-BadVis02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we'll look at a pie chart I made, of the origins of the
international students at MIT. I made this chart with the default
settings in Google Sheets.
</p>

<p>
First of all, not all of the segments are labeled, so that data is
lost, for the Middle East, Africa, Oceania, and the unknown
regions. Second, again, we have colors that are arbitrary and almost
close enough to be confusing. The difference between Asia and Africa's
colors is subtle.
</p>

<p>
And of course, the 3D-effect on the pie chart adds nothing, but does
play a subtle trick on the eye. Due to the 3D-effect, the blue and red
segments are actually larger looking, which at a glance, may lead the
viewer to overestimate their size.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BadVis03.png" alt="VIS-BadVis03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
What we are going to do now is, switch over to R and plot this data
more appropriately, using <code>ggplot</code>. And then we'll return to the
slides, to discuss some more possibilities for this data.

'data.frame':   8 obs. of  2 variables:

 $ PercentOfIntl: num  0.531 0.201 0.098 0.09 0.054 0.02 0.015 0.002
</pre>

<p>
Now, the structure of this data frame is very simple. There are two
columns, two variables. The first one, the region, and the second one
is the percentage of international students who came from that
region. So making a bar plot from this data isn't too hard.
</p>


<div id="fig:MITStudentsBarChart01" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MITStudentsPieChart01.png" alt="MITStudentsPieChart01.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 87:</span> Bar chart of MIT international students percentages</p>
</div>

<p>
So yes, we have a bar for each region. The values are between zero and
one, which looks kind of strange. The labels are actually lying over
the top of the columns, which isn't very nice, and the regions aren't
really ordered in any way that's useful.
</p>

<p>
They're actually ordered in alphabetical order, but I think it would
be much more interesting to have them in descending order. So we can
work on this.
</p>

<p>
First of all, though, what is this ~stat = "identity"~? Well, it's
pretty simple. Geometry bar has multiple modes of operation, and stat
= "identity" says, use the value of the y variable as is, which is
what we want.
</p>

<p>
The height of the bar is the value of the y variable. Now, there are
other modes, including one that counts the number of rows for each
value of x, and plots that instead.
</p>

<p>
So you can look at the documentation for <code>ggplot</code> to see the different
options and how they work. But ~stat = "identity"~ is what we want
right now. Now, the x-axis is out of order.
</p>

<p>
And the reason for this is that ggplot defaults to alphabetical order
for the x-axis. What we need to do is make Region an ordered factor
instead of an unordered factor. We can do this with the reorder
command and the transform command.
</p>

<p>
So let's write this out. So we're going to transform the international
data frame. And what we're going to do is say, Region, it's going to
be a reordering of itself, based on decreasing order of
<code>PercentOfIntl</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Make Region an ordered factor..."</span>)
<span style="color: #9932cc;"># </span><span style="color: #ba55d3;">We can do this with the re-order command and transform command.</span>
intl <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> transform(intl, Region = reorder(Region, -PercentOfIntl))

writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Look at the structure:"</span>)
str(intl)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Make Region an ordered factor...

:: Look at the structure:
..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 1
 .. .. ..$ : chr  "Africa" "Asia" "Europe" "Latin Am. &amp; Caribbean" ...
$ PercentOfIntl: num  0.531 0.201 0.098 0.09 0.054 0.02 0.015 0.002
</pre>

<p>
So if we look at the structure of the data frame now, we see there's
something going on in the Region column that wasn't going before.
</p>

<p>
And that's that ordering. So you might have also noticed that I put a
negative sign in front of <code>PercentOfIntl</code>. So that negative sign means
decreasing order.
</p>

<p>
If we had left that out, it would have actually ordered them in
increasing order. So unknown or stateless would have been first, and
Oceania would have been second, and so on. So that's one thing fixed.
</p>

<p>
Another thing we didn't like was that the numbers were between zero
and one, which looks a little bit messy. So let's just simply multiply
all the values by 100.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Make the percentages out of 100 instead of fractions..."</span>)
intl$PercentOfIntl <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> intl$PercentOfIntl * 100
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Make the percentages out of 100 instead of fractions...
</pre>

<p>
And now the other things we have to fix, like the text overlying and
the x-axis being all bunched up like that, we're going to do that in a
new ggplot command.
</p>

<p>
So I'm going to break it across multiple lines.
</p>


<div id="fig:MITpercentIntlStudentsBar02" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MITpercentIntlStudentsBar02.png" alt="MITpercentIntlStudentsBar02.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 88:</span> MIT international students percent</p>
</div>

<p>
I'm going to say <code>vjust = -0.4</code>. And what this does is, it moves the
labels up a little bit and off the top of the bars. You can play with
that. So a positive value will move it down, and a negative value will
move it up.
</p>

<p>
Next, I'm going to set the y-axis label to be something a bit more
sensible&#x2013; so "Percent of International Students".
</p>

<p>
And finally, I'd like to fix up that x-axis. So I want to get rid of
the word "Region," because it's pretty obvious these are regions. And
I also want to rotate the text at a bit of an angle, so you can read
it all on a plot like this. That's done with the <code>theme</code> command.
</p>

<p>
So we've got our labels vjust-ed above the columns. The bars
themselves are dark blue. The numbers are now between 0 and 100,
instead of zero and one.
</p>

<p>
We can read all the text labels. And it's generally a lot more
readable than the pie plot or our original <code>ggplot</code>, at that. Let's go
back to the slides now and talk about what we've just done.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Video 4: A Better Visualization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
So we just made this plot in <code>ggplot2</code>. When we compare it back to the
pie graph, the first thing I notice is that now all the data is
visible. We haven't lost the small regions and we can read out the
exact share that comes from Africa, Oceania, and the unknown or
stateless column.
</p>

<p>
I believe it is also easier to compare the relative sizes of each
region because they're all put side by side on a similar scale.
</p>

<p>
There's no tricks, or three dimensions, or colors to create a
perception issue. But, I will say that something to consider is, for
some people and some applications, being not as visually exciting is a
negative.
</p>

<p>
This plot, while very readable and correct, is certainly a little bit
dull. In some applications, this is an important consideration.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BetterVis.png" alt="VIS-BetterVis.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, wouldn't it be interesting if we could plot this data on a world
map? It would be possible, but a bit tedious to create because we need
to determine which country lies in which region.
</p>

<p>
Shading all countries in a region of the same color might be
misleading though. For example, countries in Latin America will send
students at different rates, naturally.
</p>

<p>
But, if we color them all the same color, it kind of gives a false
impression. As it turns out, we actually have access to per country
data.
</p>

<p>
So we will plot that on a world map instead and see if it is an
effective way of communicating where students come from to MIT.

In this video, we'll use the dataset <a href="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/intlall.csv">intlall.csv</a>. Please download this
dataset before starting the video. This data comes from the
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/iso">MIT International Students Office</a>.
</p>

<p>
So now we're going to try plotting a world map with a new data set
that has the number of international students from each country.
</p>

<p>
So first of all, we're going to need to use the <code>ggmap</code> package, which
you may need to install. And we're going to load in the data set,
which is called <code>intlall.csv</code>.

<p>
Let's look at the first few rows of <code>intlall</code>. So you see that each
row corresponds to a country. There's a citizenship column that's the
country name, number of undergraduates, number of graduates, special
undergraduates and graduates, exchange or visiting, and a total
column.
</p>

<p>
Now there's these NAs in here, but they're not really <code>NAs</code>. They're
just 0's. So what we're going to do is say, all these NAs should be
0's. So in intlall, all entries that are NA, should be 0. And let's
look at the first few rows again.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
Right, so next step is to load the world map.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Load the world map..."</span>)
world_map <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> map_data(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"world"</span>)
str(world_map)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Load the world map...
'data.frame':   25553 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ long     : num  -133 -132 -132 -132 -130 ...
 $ lat      : num  58.4 57.2 57 56.7 56.1 ...
 $ group    : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ order    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ region   : chr  "Canada" "Canada" "Canada" "Canada" ...
 $ subregion: chr  NA NA NA NA ...
</pre>

<p>
We did something similar in the lecture with the state data. So let's
look at the structure of the world_map. So the first two columns are
the longitude and latitude; third column is something called group &#x2013;
that's actually a group for each country, using a different number for
each country; order, we'll get to that later; region is just the
country name, and subregion is sometimes used for some countries to
describe islands and other things like that.
</p>

<p>
So we want to shove the world_map data frame and the intlall data
frame into one data frame, so we can use it for <code>ggplot</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Lets merge intlall into world_map using the merge command..."</span>)

str(world_map)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Lets merge intlall into world_map using the merge command...
'data.frame':	13595 obs. of  12 variables:
 $ region         : chr  "Albania" "Albania" "Albania" "Albania" ...
 $ long           : num  19.5 21 19.4 20.7 20.3 ...

 $ Total          : int  4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ...
</pre>

<p>
Now, in world_map, the country name is just called <code>region</code>, as you can
see right here. And in the <code>intlall</code>, the country name is actually
called <code>Citizenship</code>.
</p>

<p>
So to plot a map, we use the <code>geom_polygon</code> geometry.
</p>


<div id="fig:MITPercentIntStudentsMap01" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MITPercentIntStudentsMap01.png" alt="MITPercentIntStudentsMap01.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 91:</span> MIT international students percent world map v1</p>
</div>

<p>
So that looks kind of like a world map. There's a few things going on
here. So first of all, all the countries look like big black blobs.
</p>

<p>
What on earth is going on, you might say. Well, sometimes the merge
can reorder the data.
</p>

<p>
And it turns out that what the world_map data frame really is is
actually a list of latitude and longitude points that define the
border of each country. So if we accidentally reorder the data frame
they no longer make any sense.
</p>

<p>
And as it goes from point to point, the points might be on the other
side of the country as it defines the polygon. So, we have to reorder
the data in the correct order.
</p>

<p>
So this command is a little bit complicated looking, but when you
break it down, it's not so bad.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Reorder the data..."</span>)
world_map <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> world_map[order(world_map$group, world_map$order),]
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Reorder the data...
</pre>

<p>
So if we go and try plotting it again. Right, so now we have the map,
and it looks far more reasonable.
</p>


<div id="fig:MITPercentIntStudentsMap02" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MITPercentIntStudentsMap02.png" alt="MITPercentIntStudentsMap02.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 92:</span> MIT international students percent map v2</p>
</div>

<p>
Some of the countries are missing. Now of course, the USA is missing
because MIT is in the USA, so that wouldn't be an international
student coming from the USA.
</p>

<p>
And some parts of Africa are missing, presumably because there are no
students at MIT right now who are from those countries. But you'll
also notice that Russia is missing, and a lot of countries near it, as
well as China.
</p>

<p>
Which is definitely not true because I have many friends at MIT who
are from Russia and China. So, what do we do about that? The reason
China is missing is that it has a different name in the MIT data frame
than in the world_map data frame.
</p>

<p>
So when we merged them, it was dropped from the data set because it
didn't match up. So to see what it's called in the MIT data frame,
let's just do a table.
</p>

<p>
There's a few ways to do this, but this is pretty easy.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Lets look for China:"</span>)

                    Cambodia                     Cameroon
                           1                            1
                      Canada                        Chile

</pre>

<p>
OK, so we get a list of all the names. If we scroll all the way up,
we'll see it says "China (People's Republic Of)".
</p>

<p>
Now, in the world_map data frame, it's simply called "China". So, what
we can do is change the MIT data frame. So let's say the citizenship
column, the one row where it equals "China (People's Republic Of)"
should just be "China".

<p>
So Russia is missing for similar reasons, but we won't deal with that
now because it's a little bit annoying. But you get the idea. This is
pretty interesting actually. So we can see that Canada, and China, and
India supply a large number of international students to MIT.
</p>

<p>
But it is a little bit confusing doing it on a per country basis,
because Europe, presumably, has quite a few students at MIT.
</p>

<p>
But because Europe is made up of many small countries, it doesn't look
very impressive. Maybe if all the European countries were grouped
together, it would look about the same color as Canada. But it's hard
to tell.
</p>

<p>
There are also other projections we can look at. So this is a Mercator
projection. What I want to show you is an orthographic projection that
allows you to sort of view the map in 3D, like a globe. So let's try
that out.
</p>


<div id="fig:MITPercentIntStudentsMap04" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MITPercentIntStudentsMap04.png" alt="MITPercentIntStudentsMap04.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 94:</span> MIT international students percent map v4</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's change it to orthographic projection. And I want to find, now,
an orientation. And this is almost like thinking about where in the
world you want to focus on.
</p>

<p>
So this is a latitude and longitude, 20 degrees and 30 degrees. If we
run this, we should get a map centered above North Africa.
</p>

<p>
That's quite a nice visualization because if you want to look just at
Africa and Europe, this is the way to go. We can still see China, and
Canada, and South America in there, as well.
</p>

<p>
Let's do something a little bit more personal. I want to change the
coordinates, now, to -37 and 175. Now it's centered on my hometown of
Auckland, New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
This first plot shows the average height of a 21-year-old male in
centimeters. The x-axis is time, starting in 1871, and ending
in 1975. Each person represents the height, at a different point in
time, and the points are evenly spaced in time, so the x-axis is OK.
</p>

<p>
The y-axis ranges from just under 160 to 180 centimeters, which isn't
inherently bad, but does overstate the change.
</p>

<p>
The real problem is the bars. If it was accurate, we would only really
see the heads of the men, but instead we see their whole bodies,
making it seem as if people have not only doubled in height, but
they've also double in width.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BadScales.png" alt="VIS-BadScales.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This next plot also has issues with scale. The total range of the plot
is 8% to 10%, although all the numbers fall in the range of 8.6% to
9.2%. If we plotted the y-axis on a 0% to 10% scale, the conclusion
would be that nothing is really changing at all.
</p>

<p>
The last point in the chart is at the wrong height, and the size of
the markers makes the relative locations hard to distinguish.
</p>

<p>
Also notice that the gap between 9.0% and the 8.9% markers on the far
left side, and the 8.9% and 8.8% markers, have a different gap.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BadScales02.png" alt="VIS-BadScales02.png" />

</div>

<p>
This plot shows the relative breakdown of teachers by race in a
certain teaching program. The Caucasian bar is truncated, which is a
risky choice, but could be appropriate in some situations.
</p>

<p>
A much bigger problem is that the scale of each blue bar is entirely
different. For example, the Native American bar is about a third of
the length of the African American bar, but there are more than 10
times as many African Americans in this program as Native Americans.
</p>

<p>
In fact, visually, this plot is completely meaningless.
</p>

<p>
The only useful thing about it is the numbers. But even there, there
is a bit of confusion, as Native Americans are given to one decimal
place, but the others are rounded.
</p>

<p>
Which when combined with the confusing scales, casts doubt on the
correctness of the numbers.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-BadScales03.png" alt="VIS-BadScales03.png" />

<p>
Here is a before and after of the same data. On the left, we see the
US military expense in the right axis, and troop count on the left
axis. Both the line and bar plots are individually OK, but the
combination is misleading.
</p>

<p>
Because you have mixed two units, dollars and people, there is a false
impression of some sort of crossover point in 1995 that does not
exist.
</p>

<p>
On the right is the same data presented in a different way. We now
have troops on the x-axis, and dollars on the y-axis. The line moves
through time now, allowing us to see when moments of change occurred,
such as decreases in troop count, through the 90s, at the end of the
Cold War, the increase in spending of the 2000s, and the recent
decreases in military spending.

The final visualization I want to show you today is all about the
different types of household. The US Census Bureau periodically
determines how many households are comprised, for example, of married
couples with and without children, people living alone, and so on.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/VIS-FamilyMatters.png" alt="VIS-FamilyMatters.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
First of all, I'm not saying this is a bad visualization. In fact, if
we are interested in the relative share of each type of household in a
particular year, it's actually pretty good.
</p>

<p>
However, if what we're interested in is the rates of change across the
years, this is next to useless. The key problem is that the x-axis is
completely off. The gap between the first two columns is 10 years, but
the gap between the last two columns is only 2 years, meaning that the
rates are hard to read from this.
</p>

<p>
If we're not interested in the rates of changes, but just want to
compare two years at a time, it's not bad, but it's not easy
either. Try comparing 1970 married without children to 2010 married
without children, without looking at the numbers. Can you tell if it
has grown or shrunk?
</p>

<p>
Finally, and more generally, this chart shows relative numbers. If you
look at absolute numbers, we might find the total number of couples
married with children is actually constant, but the number of other
households has increased.

</pre>

<p>
If we look at the structure of households, we see that there is a year
column and then six other columns for each of the different household
types. So this is actually a problem for us. Given this structure of a
data frame, what would we put in the aesthetic for our <code>ggplot</code>
command?
</p>

<p>
It's not obvious, to me at least, and in fact, I don't think it's
really possible. The reason is that ggplot needs it in the form of:
<code>year</code>, <code>group</code>, and <code>fraction</code>.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to use the <code>melt</code> function from the reshape
package. Melt will take a 2-dimensional data frame like ours, and
convert it into exactly the right form we need for <code>ggplot2</code>.
</p>

<p>
So first, let's load <code>reshape2</code>. Now, let's look at the first two
columns of our households data frame.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Load reshape2..."</span>)
<span style="color: #db7093;">library</span>(reshape2)

writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Lets look at the first two columns of our households dataframe:"</span>)
households[,1:2]
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Load reshape2...

 :: Lets look at the first two columns of our households dataframe:
  Year MarriedWChild
1 1970          40.3
2 1980          30.9
3 1990          26.3
4 1995          25.5
5 2000          24.1
6 2005          22.9
7 2010          20.9
8 2012          19.6
</pre>

<p>
So there's a <code>Year</code> and a <code>MarriedWChild</code> for each year. Now, let's
look at the first few rows of our melted households data frame.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: First few rows of our melted households dataframe:"</span>)
head(melt(households, id=<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Year"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: First few rows of our melted households dataframe:
  Year      variable value
1 1970 MarriedWChild  40.3
2 1980 MarriedWChild  30.9
3 1990 MarriedWChild  26.3
4 1995 MarriedWChild  25.5
5 2000 MarriedWChild  24.1
6 2005 MarriedWChild  22.9
</pre>

<p>
So, basically, what's happened is that each value of MarriedWChild has
turned into its own row in the new data frame. To make it more clear,
perhaps, let's look at the first three columns of households.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: Three few rows of our melted households dataframe:"</span>)
households[,1:3]
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: Three few rows of our melted households dataframe:
  Year MarriedWChild MarriedWOChild
1 1970          40.3           30.3
2 1980          30.9           29.9
3 1990          26.3           29.8
4 1995          25.5           28.9
5 2000          24.1           28.7
6 2005          22.9           28.3
7 2010          20.9           28.8
8 2012          19.6           29.1
</pre>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"\n :: First few rows of our melted households dataframe:"</span>)
melt(households, id=<span style="color: #ff6a6a;">"Year"</span>)[1:10,]
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 :: First few rows of our melted households dataframe:
   Year       variable value
1  1970  MarriedWChild  40.3
2  1980  MarriedWChild  30.9
3  1990  MarriedWChild  26.3
4  1995  MarriedWChild  25.5
5  2000  MarriedWChild  24.1
6  2005  MarriedWChild  22.9
7  2010  MarriedWChild  20.9
8  2012  MarriedWChild  19.6
9  1970 MarriedWOChild  30.3
10 1980 MarriedWOChild  29.9
</pre>

<p>
So there you can see the eight values of <code>MarriedWChild</code>, and the
first two values of <code>MarriedWOChild</code>. So there's that 30.3 up there,
gone down to 30.3 here, 29.9 gone to down here.
</p>

<p>
So every value in our data frame now corresponds to a new row in our
melted data frame, which is exactly what we need for <code>ggplot</code>.
</p>

<p>
So let's try plotting this melted data frame.
</p>


<div id="fig:MeltedHouseholdsPlot01" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MeltedHouseholdsPlot01.png" alt="MeltedHouseholdsPlot01.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 102:</span> Percentage of households by types across years</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, this is actually quite interesting when we compare it back to the
chart we had in the slides. Now you can see just how quickly
<code>MarriedWChild</code> is decreasing as a relative share. You can also more
clearly see that <code>MarriedWOChild</code> is pretty much flat, and that the
differences being made up by the other four types of households is
steadily increasing over the years.
</p>

<p>
So there you have it, the same data, plotted in two different
ways. Now, I'm not saying one of these is better than the other
one. For example, if I want to compare inside a given year, say 1970,
it's not the most easy thing, at a glance, to see just how much of a
total hundred percent is taken up by each.
</p>

<p>
But if I want to see across years, it's far superior. And I can
clearly see that the last data point is pretty much right next to the
second to last data point, which is something that was hard to tell
with the other visualization.
</p>

<p>
So I hope this has made you think a little bit more about the
different ways you can plot the same data. And hopefully improved your
ggplot2 skills a little bit more.
