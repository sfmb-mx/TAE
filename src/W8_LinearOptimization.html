</p>
</div>

<p>
We will introduce linear optimization and apply it to airline revenue
management. Air transportation became a reality in the United States
in the 20th century.
</p>

<p>
From 1938 to 1978, the Civil Aeronautics Board set fares, routes, and
schedules for all interstate air transport.
</p>

<p>
Most airlines were very positive on this system, as it guaranteed
their profits. However, this system led to higher costs for a
traveling public as well as to various inefficiencies.
</p>

<p>
For example, applications for new routes and fares were often delayed
or dismissed.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-AirlinesRegulation.png" alt="LO-AirlinesRegulation.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In response to these inefficiencies, the administration of President
Carter passed the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978. The act encouraged
more competition. As a result, 52 new airlines were formed between
1980 and 2000.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-AirlinesDeRegulation.png" alt="LO-AirlinesDeRegulation.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
More competition led to lower fares, as we discussed, while meeting
operating costs. This further led to heavy losses by air carriers.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-ACompetitiveEdge.png" alt="LO-ACompetitiveEdge.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>So it is natural to ask how did airlines compete?</b> In their attempt
to sell more seats, airlines started to offer deep discounts. For
example, on January 17, 1985, American Airlines launched its Ultimate
Super Saver fares to compete with <b>PeopleExpress</b>.
</p>

<p>
The key strategy involved selling enough seats to cover fixed
operating costs while selling remaining seats at higher rates to
maximize revenues.
</p>

<p>
This led to the science of revenue management that we will study.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-DiscountFares.png" alt="LO-DiscountFares.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The key question in revenue management is how many seats to sell on
discount. The key consideration is that passengers have different
valuations. For example, business people value flexibility, whereas
people seeking a vacation value good deals. So if we sell too many
discounted seats, then there would not be enough seats for high-paying
passengers.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, if we sell too few discounted seats, then we will
have empty seats, which lead to lost revenue.
</p>

<p>
So the key question is <b>how airlines like American can allocate their
seats among customers in order to maximize their revenue</b>.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Video 2: A Single Flight</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
To illustrate how linear optimization works in revenue management, let
us consider a simple example: A flight from New York to Los Angeles.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-LetsStartSimple.png" alt="LO-LetsStartSimple.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In this flight, there are two types of economy fares, Early Bird fares
that cost $238, and Last Minute fares that cost $617.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-TicketPrices.png" alt="LO-TicketPrices.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In this flight, a Boeing 757 is used that has 166 economy seats.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Boeing757-200SeatMap.png" alt="LO-Boeing757-200SeatMap.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Demand for these prices has been forecasted using analytics tools,
looking at historical data and incorporating models like time series
or linear regression.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, forecasts have errors, and therefore, we need to assess the
sensitivity of our decisions to these errors.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the use of linear optimization, we assume that demand
has already been forecasted.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-DemandForecasting.png" alt="LO-DemandForecasting.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We'll illustrate how our decisions on how many discount seats to sell
vary as the demand forecasts vary. If the demand for regular seats is
50, and for discounted fares is 150, and the capacity is 166 seats,
then the optimal allocation is going to be to sell the 50 seats to
satisfy the regular demand, and then we allocate the remaining 116
seats to the discounted fare class.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MyopicSolution.png" alt="LO-MyopicSolution.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If the regular demand increases to 100 seats, then we allocate these
100 seats to these customers, and only 66 seats to discounted fare
customers.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MyopicSolution02.png" alt="LO-MyopicSolution02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Finally, if the regular demand increases to 200, then we allocate all
of our capacity, 166 seats, to these customers.
</p>

<p>
While this seems simple, what happens if we have 100 flights with
connections in tens of fares? We'll next see how to formulate the
problem mathematically and solve it in a systematic way, using linear
optimization.

<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
We would sell 150 seats to regular customers, giving us a revenue of
$617*150, and 16 seats to discount customers, giving us a revenue of
$238*16. Our total revenue would be <code>$617*150 + $238*16 = $96,358</code>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Video 3: The Problem Formulation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
For a single route example, our problem is to find the optimal number
of discount seats and regular seats to sell to maximize revenue. We'll
assume that the price of regular seats is $617, and the price of
discount seats is $238. Also, let's assume that we forecasted the
demand of regular seats to be 100, and the demand of discount seats to
be 150.
</p>

<p>
The capacity of our airplane is 166 seats.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-SingleRouteExample.png" alt="LO-SingleRouteExample.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's go ahead and formulate this mathematically as a linear
optimization problem.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to decide what our decisions are, or the variables
in our model. We need to decide how many regular seats we went to
sell. We'll call the number of regular seats we sell R. We also need
to decide the number of discount seats we want to sell. We'll call the
number of discount seats we sell D.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step1_Decisions.png" alt="LO-Step1_Decisions.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The second step is to decide what our objective, or our goal, is. In
this case, it's to maximize the total revenue to the airline. The
revenue from each type of seat is equal to the number of that type of
seat sold times the seat price.
</p>

<p>
In the case of regular seats, this is $617 times R, the number of
regular seats we sell. And for discount seats, this is $230 times D,
the number of discount seats we sell.
</p>

<p>
We sum these together to get the total revenue, and our objective is
to maximize this sum.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step2_Objective.png" alt="LO-Step2_Objective.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The third step is to define the constraints, or limits, of our
decisions. One constraint is that American Airlines can't sell more
seats than the aircraft capacity, which is 166 seats. So the total
number of seats sold, R + D has to be less than or equal to the
capacity of 166.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, American Airlines shouldn't sell more seats than the
demand for each type of seat. So the regular seats, R, shouldn't
exceed 100. So R should be less than or equal to 100. And the discount
seats, D, can't exceed 150. So D should be less than or equal to 150.
</p>

The final step is to make sure our variables are taking reasonable
values. In this case, it wouldn't make sense to sell a negative number
of seats, so we need to make sure that both R and D are greater than
or equal to 0.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step4_Non-Negativity.png" alt="LO-Step4_Non-Negativity.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So our entire problem is to maximize total airline revenue, subject to
the constraints that seats sold can't exceed capacity, seats sold
can't exceed demand, and the seats sold can't be negative.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-ProblemFormulation.png" alt="LO-ProblemFormulation.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mathematically, this can be written as shown in the figure. Which \(R\)
and \(D\) are the demand constraints; and \(R\) and \(D\) are both greater
than or equal to 0.
</p>

<p>
This is called a <b>linear optimization problem</b>.

</p>

<p>
If you are using LibreOffice or OpenOffice, the functions and solver
will look very similar to what you see in this video. If you are using
<b>Microsoft Excel, please see the helpful tips below this video</b>.
</p>

<p>
We'll solve our linear optimization problem in the software
LibreOffice. LibreOffice is similar to Microsoft Excel, but it's an
open source software, and is available for free on the internet.
</p>

<p>
Another option we could use is OpenOffice. You're welcome to use
Excel, OpenOffice, or LibreOffice in this course, and whenever we
mention LibreOffice, keep in mind that you could be using one of the
other softwares instead.
</p>

<p>
For more information about the options, see the download instructions
on edX. You should have already downloaded and installed LibreOffice.
</p>

<p>
If not, follow the instructions on edX before continuing with this
video. Go ahead and open the file, Week9_AirlineRM.ods.
</p>

<p>
I've already set up the data for our problem and places for us to
build our decisions, our objective, and our constraints. The decisions
are highlighted in yellow.
</p>

<p>
These are the number of regular seats to sell, and the number of
discount seats to sell. We'll just leave these cells blank for now,
since the solver will be finding the optimal values. Our objective,
which we saw in the previous video, is to maximize total revenue.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR-Libreoffice.png" alt="AR-Libreoffice.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's go ahead and build the objective in this blue cell. It should
equal the price of regular seats, times the number of regular seats we
sell, plus the price the discount seats, times the number of discount
seats we sell.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR-ObjectiveFunction.png" alt="AR-ObjectiveFunction.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You should see 0 in this cell. That's because right now, we're not
selling any seats. Our decision cells are blank. This could be a
little tedious if we had more than two decisions.
</p>

<p>
To make it easier, we can use a nice function called sumproduct to
build our objective.
</p>

<p>
Now in the objective cell, let's type equals, and then sumproduct, and
then in parentheses, select the two prices, type a semicolon, and then
select the two seats.
</p>

<p>
This will multiply the first price times the first decision variable,
and the second price times the second decision variable, and add them
up. Close the parentheses and hit Enter.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you're using Excel, you should use a comma instead of a
semicolon.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR-ObjectiveFunction02.png" alt="AR-ObjectiveFunction02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now let's construct our constraints. The first constraint is the
capacity constraint. The green table here allows us to easily write
out our constraints in terms of what's on the left-hand side, LHS,
what the sign is, like equals, less than or equals, or greater than or
equals, and what's on the right-hand side, or RHS, of the constraint.
</p>

<p>
So for the capacity constraint, the left-hand side is equal to the
number of regular seats plus the number of discount seats.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR-Constraints.png" alt="AR-Constraints.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The sign is less than or equals, and the right-hand side is 166, the
capacity of our aircraft.
</p>

<p>
The regular demand constraint should be the regular number of seats,
which should be less than or equal to the regular demand, which
equals 100. The discount demand should be the number of discount
seats, which should be less than or equal to the demand, which is
equal to 150. Note here that whenever I pick the seats or the demand,
I pick those cells up on the top.
</p>

<p>
That's because if we want to change our demand, we could easily change
it up at the top, and all of our constraints will change too.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's add in our non-negativity constraints. So the number of
regular seats should be greater than or equal to 0, and the number of
discount seats should be greater than or equal to 0.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR-Constraints02.png" alt="AR-Constraints02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now we're ready to solve our problem. To do this, we just go to the
Tools menu in LibreOffice and select Solver.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR_Solver.png" alt="AR_Solver.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now we need to fill in the information about our problem. The "Target
cell" should be the objective. So with the blinking cursor in the
target cell, select the objective cell.
</p>

<p>
We should also be selecting <b>Maximum</b>, since we're trying to maximize
the total revenue.
</p>

<p>
The area called <b>By changing cells</b> should be our decision variables,
so go ahead and select that blank area, and select the decision
variables.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Limiting conditions</b> are our constraints. The <b>Cell reference</b>
should be the left-hand side of the constraint, the <b>Operator</b> is the
sign, and the <b>Value</b> is the right-hand side.
</p>

<p>
For constraints with the same sign, if they're in a row, we could
select them at once to be more efficient.
</p>

<p>
So first, let's select the first three less than or equal to
constraints. We want to make sure the operator is less than or equal
to, the integer and binary options you see here, we'll explain next
week, and the value should be the right-hand side of these
constraints.
</p>

<p>
Then we need to add in the greater than or equal to constraints. So
select the two left-hand sides. The operator should be greater than or
equal to, and the value should be the two right-hand sides.
</p>

<p>
The last thing we want to do is in Options, make sure that the
LibreOffice Linear Solver is selected.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR_Solver02.png" alt="AR_Solver02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Click OK, and then hit Solve. The solving result should say: "Solving
successfully finished.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR_Solver03.png" alt="AR_Solver03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Result: \(77,408\). This is the objective of our optimal solution, and is
the total revenue we get. Go ahead and click Keep Result.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR_Solver04.png" alt="AR_Solver04.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
And now back in our spreadsheet, we can see that our solution is to
sell 100 regular seats and 66 discount seats. You may be thinking that
you could have done this without the Solver.
</p>

<p>
But when the problems become more complicated, it's very difficult and
often impossible to solve them by hand.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-1">
<p>
If you are using Microsoft Excel, the functions and solver you will be
using are similar, but not identical, to what you see in the
video. Here are some helpful tips to assist in using Excel for this
class.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unlike LibreOffice and OpenOffice, the "Solver" option does not
typically come pre-loaded into Excel. If you are on a Mac and you
don't see "Solver&#x2026;" in the Tools menu, you will need to add it in
by going to the Tools menu, and selecting "Add-Ins&#x2026;". Then, check
"Solver.Xlam" if it is not already checked, and click OK. You should
now see "Solver&#x2026;" under the Tools menu. If you are on a Windows
computer and you don't see Solver in the Data tab, go to the File
menu, and click on "Options". Then select "Add-ins", then "Manage
Excel Add-ins" and click Go. Check "Solver Add-in" if it is not
already checked, and click OK. You might need to search for
"SOLVER.XLAM" if you don't see a checkbox and click through a
security warning about running macros within Excel - please click OK
and run the macros. You should now see Solver in the Analysis
section of the Data tab. You might experience various issues if you
are using an older version of Excel - please visit the discussion
foum or search on Google to get help with these problems.
</li>

<li>When using the sumproduct function, you should separate the two
groups of cells with a comma, instead of a semicolon. So whenever we
say semicolon in LibreOffice, you probably want a comma in Excel.
</li>

<li>Specifying the objective and decision variables is very similar to
how it is done in LibreOffice, but the constraints are slightly
different. To add a new constraint, you should click on the "Add"
button to the right of the "Subject to the Constraints" box. This
will change the window into one that looks more like how we are
adding constraints in LibreOffice. After filling in the
left-hand-side, sign, and right-hand-side, you can click on "Add" to
add the constraint to your model and to continue adding constraints,
or click "OK" to stop adding constraints. If you click "Cancel" it
will just bring you back to the Solver window, without doing
anything. You can change or delete a constraint by just selecting it
and clicking the "Change" or "Delete" buttons next to the "Subject
to the Constraints" box.
</li>

<li>Excel has a nice way of specifying non-negativity constraints. You
can just check the "Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative" box
insteading of adding the non-negativity constraints.
</li>

<li>You should always select the "Simplex LP" solving method in this
class.

<h3 id="sec-1-8"><span class="section-number-3">1.8</span> Video 5: Visualizing the Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
So we saw in the previous video how we can solve linear optimization
problems in LibreOffice. Let's now try to get some intuition for
what's going on by visualizing our problem.
</p>

<p>
Since we only have two decisions, R and D, we can visualize our
constraints in two dimensions. We'll plot D on the x-axis, and R on
the y-axis. We first have non-negativity constraints, so R and D are
both greater than zero.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-VisualizingProblem.png" alt="LO-VisualizingProblem.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We can plot the capacity constraint, \(R + D\) less than or equal to 166,
which is shown as the red line here. Our solution has to be to the
left of this line according to this constraint.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-VisualizingProblem02.png" alt="LO-VisualizingProblem02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, let's add in our demand constraints. The regular seats should be
less than the demand of 100, which requires the solution to be below
this blue line.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-VisualizingProblem03.png" alt="LO-VisualizingProblem03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
And the discount seats should be less than the demand of 150, which
requires the solution to be to the left of this green line.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-VisualizingProblem04.png" alt="LO-VisualizingProblem04.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Taken together, our constraints define what we call our "feasible
space" or the space of all possible values that our decisions can take
according to our constraints.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-FeasibleSpace.png" alt="LO-FeasibleSpace.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
To find the optimal solution now in our feasible space, we have to use
the objective, \(617*R + 238*D\).
</p>

<p>
We can plot this objective in our feasible space. So to know how many
seats we should sell to achieve a certain revenue, we can see
different values of this line.
</p>

<p>
So to achieve a revenue of $20,000, our solution has to be somewhere
on this line in our feasible space.
</p>

<p>
To achieve a revenue of $40,000, our solution has to be somewhere on
this line in our feasible space. And to achieve a revenue of $60,000,
our solution has to be somewhere on this line in our feasible space.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-PossibleSolutions.png" alt="LO-PossibleSolutions.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Since the revenue is increasing as we move this line up and our goal
is to maximize the revenue, our optimal solution will be where this
line can't go any further and still be in our feasible space.
</p>

<p>
So our optimal solution is at this point with a revenue of $77,408.
</p>

<p>
As we can see here, the solution is dependent on how the feasible
space was defined.

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
In the first case, our optimal solution will not change because we are
only offering 66 discount seats. So even if the demand goes down to
100, we are not meeting the demand. But in the second case, we can
only offer 50 discount seats. So our airplane will not be full, and
our optimal solution will change to 100 regular seats and 50 discount
seats.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-10"><span class="section-number-3">1.10</span> Video 6: Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-10">
<p>
Often, in linear optimization problems, we've estimated the data we're
using in the problem, but it's subject to change.
</p>

<p>
Understanding how the solution changes when the data changes is called
<b>sensitivity analysis</b>.
</p>

<p>
One way that the data could change is through marketing
decisions. Suppose that American Airlines' management is trying to
figure out whether or not it would be beneficial to invest in
marketing its fares.
</p>

<p>
They forecast that the marketing effort is likely to attract one more
unit of demand, of each type, for every $200 spent.
</p>

<p>
So for the discount fare, the marketing cost per unit is $200, and for
the regular fare, the marketing cost per unit is also $200. We want to
know how much this will increase our marginal revenue for each type of
fare.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDecisions.png" alt="LO-MarketingDecisions.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This graph shows our current feasible space and optimal solution. What
would happen if we increased the marketing for discount fares?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDiscountFares.png" alt="LO-MarketingDiscountFares.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The demand for discount fares would increase. But since we're not even
meeting the current demand for discount fares with the optimal
solution, this doesn't give us any extra revenue.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDiscountFares02.png" alt="LO-MarketingDiscountFares02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So we shouldn't add any marketing for discount fares. Actually,
American Airlines could decrease their budget to market discount
fares, and even if the demand decreases, it wouldn't change our
revenue.
</p>

<p>
The demand could go all the way down to 66 without affecting our
decisions.
</p>

<p>
In <b>sensitivity analysis</b> like this, we're often concerned with the
shadow price of a constraint. For a discount demand constraint, this
is the marginal revenue gained by increasing the demand by one unit.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the shadow price is 0 for demand greater than or equal
to 66.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDiscountFares03.png" alt="LO-MarketingDiscountFares03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, let's look at what happens when we market regular fares. If we
increase the demand for regular fares, our revenue increases.
</p>

<p>
If we increase by 25 units of demand, our revenue increases to
$86,883. If we increase by another 25 units of demand, our revenue
increases to $96,358. So what's the shadow price in this case?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDiscountFares04.png" alt="LO-MarketingDiscountFares04.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Remember that the shadow price is the marginal revenue for a unit
increase in demand, in this case, of regular seats.
</p>

<p>
From 100 to 125, the revenue increased by $86,883 minus $77,408, which
is equal to $9,475. Since this was an increase of 25 units of demand,
the shadow price is 9,475 divided by 25, which equals 379. We can
calculate that this is the same shadow price from 125 to 150.
</p>

<p>
So the marginal revenue for every extra unit of regular demand from
100 to 166 is $379.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDiscountFares05.png" alt="LO-MarketingDiscountFares05.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So given this analysis, how can we help the marketing department make
their decisions? The forecast was an extra unit of demand for every
$200 spent. For discount fares, this isn't worth it, since the shadow
price, or marginal revenue, is 0. But for the regular fares, this is
worth it, since the shadow price is $379.
</p>

<p>
So the marketing department should invest in marketing regular fares
to increase the demand by 66 units.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MarketingDecisions02.png" alt="LO-MarketingDecisions02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another sensitivity analysis question in our problem is whether or not
it would be beneficial to allocate a bigger aircraft for this
flight. This would change the capacity constraint, which currently
limits the capacity to 166.
</p>

<p>
With our current aircraft, the management knows that the cost per hour
is $12,067. So the total cost of the six-hour flight is $72,402. With
the 166 seats filled, we get a revenue of $77,408 from our optimal
solution (Original Aircraft).
</p>

<p>
If we increase the capacity of the aircraft to 176 seats, the total
cost would increase to $76,590. But how much would this increase our
revenue?
</p>

<p>
And if we increase the capacity of the aircraft to 218 seats, the total
cost would increase to $87,342. But how much would this increase our
revenue?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-CapacityAllocation.png" alt="LO-CapacityAllocation.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
For our analysis, let's assume that the demand does not change.
</p>

<p>
If we increase our capacity to 176, the capacity constraint will move
right. And our optimal solution will move right too. We now get a
revenue of $79,788.
</p>

<p>
If we then increase the capacity to 218 seats, the capacity constraint
will move right again, and our revenue will increase to $89,784.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-AircraftCapacity.png" alt="LO-AircraftCapacity.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So let's look at our extra profit from increasing the capacity to see
if it's worth it. With our current costs and revenue, the profit is
$5,006.
</p>

<p>
If we increase the capacity to 176 seats, our profit actually
decreases to $3,198. And if we increase the capacity to 218 seats, our
profit decreases even more to $2,442.
</p>

<p>
So even though our revenue is increasing, the cost increases too.
</p>

<p>
So <b>it's not profitable for us to increase the capacity of our
aircraft</b>.

intuitive and more widely used in the business world. However, you

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-13" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-13"><span class="section-number-3">1.13</span> Video 7: Connecting Flights</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-13">
<p>
We've only considered optimizing the fares for a single route. In this
video, we'll change our optimization formulation to include connecting
flights.
</p>

<p>
Now, instead of just being able to go from JFK in New York to LAX in
Los Angeles, let's suppose that the plane stops in Dallas at the
Dallas Fort Worth airport. We still are just using one plane, but the
passengers can now fly from New York to Dallas, Dallas to Los Angeles,
or from New York to Los Angeles by just staying on the plane in
Dallas.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-ConnectingFlights.png" alt="LO-ConnectingFlights.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>So how does our optimization problem change?</b> We now have six types
of seats that we can offer: the original two types, regular and
discount from New York to LA, and four new types.
</p>

<p>
We can sell both regular and discount seats from New York to Dallas,
and regular and discount seats from Dallas to Los Angeles. We know the
price of each type of ticket as well as the forecasted demand for each
type of ticket.
</p>

<p>
We also know that we have a capacity of 166 seats on our plane for
each leg of the trip. There's room for 166 passengers on the plane
from New York to Dallas, or the first leg of the trip. Then the
passengers with a final destination of Dallas will get off the plane
and the passengers flying from Dallas to LA will get on the plane.
</p>

<p>
On the second leg of the trip, flying from Dallas to LA, we also have
a capacity of 166 seats. So we need to remember that the passengers
flying from New York to LA will take up capacity on both legs of the
trip, while the other types of passengers will only take up capacity
on one leg of the trip.
</p>

<p>
<b>So what are our decisions now?</b> They're the number of regular tickets
to sell for each type, and the number of discount tickets to sell for
each type. So in total, we have six decisions to make.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step1_Decisions02.png" alt="LO-Step1_Decisions02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, let's define our objective. Like before, it's to maximize the
total revenue. This is the sum of the price of the ticket times the
number of seats of that type we sell, for each type of ticket.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step2_Objective02.png" alt="LO-Step2_Objective02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
And like before, we have two types of constraints&#x2013; capacity
constraints and demand constraints. For the capacity constraints, the
airline shouldn't sell more seats than the capacity of the plane, for
each leg of the trip.
</p>

<p>
So we need two capacity constraints here: one for the New York to
Dallas leg and one for the Dallas to LA leg.
</p>

<p>
Note that the New York to LA passengers have to be counted on both
legs of the trip. So the first constraint accounts for all passengers
that need to be on the plane when it flies from New York to Dallas,
and the second constraint accounts for all passengers that need to be
on the plane when it flies from Dallas to LA.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step3_Constraints02.png" alt="LO-Step3_Constraints02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We also need six demand constraints, one for each type of ticket. The
number of seats sold should not exceed the forecasted demand for each
type.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step3_Constraints03.png" alt="LO-Step3_Constraints03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
And lastly, we can't sell a negative number of seats, so we have our
non-negativity constraints to prevent the variables from being
negative. Let's now go to LibreOffice and adjust our formulation to
solve this bigger problem.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Step4_Non-Negativity02.png" alt="LO-Step4_Non-Negativity02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In LibreOffice, go ahead and open the file
<code>Week9_AirlineRM_Connecting.ods</code>. In this file, I've set up our data,
our decisions, our objective, and our constraints. Our decisions,
again, are highlighted in yellow. We have a decision for each type of
seat on each flight. Our objective here is the spot in blue. To build
our objective, we'll use the sumproduct function.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR2_Optimization.png" alt="AR2_Optimization.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So type = and then sumproduct, and in parentheses, select all six
prices, type a semicolon, and then select all six decisions.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR2_OptimizationInit.png" alt="AR2_OptimizationInit.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now let's create our constraints. The first constraints are capacity
constraints. The first is the capacity on the leg from New York to
Dallas. The left-hand side should be equal to the seats from New York
to LA plus the seats from New York to Dallas.
</p>

<p>
The sign is less than or equals and the right-hand side is 166, the
capacity of our aircraft.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR2_OptimizationConstrain.png" alt="AR2_OptimizationConstrain.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The sign is less than or equals and the right-hand side is 166, the
capacity of our aircraft.
</p>

<p>
Now we need to build the capacity constraint from Dallas to LA. The
left-hand side is equal to the seats from New York to LA plus the
seats from Dallas to LA. Our sign is, again, less than or equals and
our right-hand side is 166.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR2_OptimizationConstrain02.png" alt="AR2_OptimizationConstrain02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Our final model is:
</p>



<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR2_OptimizationConstrain03.png" alt="AR2_OptimizationConstrain03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So now go ahead and in the Tools menu, select Solver. We need to first
fill in the target cell, which should be the objective. Make sure that
Maximum is selected. Then, in the Changing Cells box, select all six
decisions. Down in the Limiting Conditions, let's now build our
constraints.
</p>

<p>
For the Cell Reference column, let's start by selecting the left-hand
side of the two capacity constraints.
</p>

<p>
The Operator should be less than or equals and the Value should be the
right-hand side of these two capacity constraints.
</p>

<p>
Now let's make the demand constraints. In Cell Reference, just
directly select the six decision variables, make sure the Operator's
less than or equals, and for the Value, select the six demand
constraints. This is a bit easier than what we did before because we
didn't have to type them all out in our spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
Now let's do a similar thing for the non-negativity constraints, where
in Cell Reference, we select the six decisions. The Operator this time
should be greater than or equals, and for the Value, just type 0.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/AR2_OptimizationSolver.png" alt="AR2_OptimizationSolver.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Make sure in Options that the Linear Solver is selected, and go ahead
and hit Solve. The solving result should say:
</p>

<p>
"Solving successfully finished. Result: 120,514."
</p>

<p>
<b>This is our total revenue.</b>
</p>

<p>
So we see here that the optimal solution is to sell 80 tickets for the
regular price from New York to LA, 0 of the discount price from New
York to LA, 75 of the regular price from New York to Dallas, 11 of the
discount price from New York to Dallas, 60 of the regular price from
Dallas to LA, and lastly, 26 of the discount price from Dallas to LA.
</p>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
You can answer this question without re-solving the model by noticing
that we are not meeting the demand for discount fares from JFK to DFW
at all. The demand could increase by 100, and we still would not offer
more than 11 discount fares.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you could change the demand for discount fares, and
re-solve the model. The solution does not change, regardless of how
much you increase the demand.

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
In the current solution, we are meeting the demand for regular tickets
from JFK to LAX. If we increase the demand by 10, we offer 10 more
regular tickets, but our revenue only increases by $140, which does
not exceed the cost of $2000. If we increase the demand by 50, to 130,
we only offer 91 seats. Therefore, American Airlines should not market
the regular fares from JFK to LAX because even though the revenue
increases, it does not exceed the costs.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-15">
<p>
The overall revenue management problem involves a network of airports
and literally thousands of flights. Clearly optimization is
needed. Myopic solutions leave significant revenue on the table.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-ComplexNetwork.png" alt="LO-ComplexNetwork.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Furthermore, revenue management involves tens of different classes
that have different restrictions, different characteristics like mile
awards, and fares.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-MultipleFareClasses.png" alt="LO-MultipleFareClasses.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
*PEOPLExpress could not compete with American Airlines' Ultimate Super
Saver fares. Donald Burr, CEO of PEOPLExpress in 1985, notes, "We were
a vibrant, profitable company from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped
right over into losing $50 million a month.
</p>

<p>
We had been profitable from the day we started until American came at
us with Ultimate Super Savers."
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Competitive StrategyOfAA.png" alt="LO-Competitive StrategyOfAA.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Revenue management is the science of selling the right seats to the
right customers at the right prices. To illustrate the impact that
revenue management has had on American Airlines, we note what Robert
Crandall, CEO of American, wrote during the period that revenue
management practices were applied.
</p>

<p>
"Revenue management is the single most important technical development
in transportation management since we entered the era of airline
deregulation. We estimate that revenue management has generated $1.4
billion in incremental revenue in the last three years."
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-Competitive StrategyOfAA02.png" alt="LO-Competitive StrategyOfAA02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let us see the impact of revenue management more broadly. Today,
American Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy by merging with US Air
Airlines. However, American Airlines has spun off Sabre Holdings, the
entity that built revenue management for American.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/LO-TheEdgeOfRevenueManagement.png" alt="LO-TheEdgeOfRevenueManagement.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As of November 2012, Sabre ranked 133rd among America's largest
private companies with $3.15 billion in sales, 400 airlines, 90,000
hotels, and 30 car rental companies as clients. Today, companies
prosper from revenue management. Delta Airlines, for example,
increased annual revenue by $300 million.

<p>
Marriott hotels increased annual revenue by $100 million.

<p>
We will discuss how linear optimization is used to design radiation
therapy treatments for cancer patients.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RadiationTherapy.png" alt="RadiationTherapy.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States,
second only to heart disease. There were an estimated 570,000 deaths
in 2013 due to cancer. Additionally, over 1.6 million new cases of
cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2013.
</p>

<p>
These trends are also seen throughout the world. Worldwide, cancer is
a leading cause of death, with 8.2 million deaths in 2012.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT02.png" alt="RT02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Cancer can be treated using radiation therapy, where beams of
high-energy photons are fired into the patient to kill cancerous
cells.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT03.png" alt="RT03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Radiation therapy has a history going back to the late 1800s. X-rays
were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen in 1895, who was later awarded the
first Nobel Prize in Physics.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the discovery, X-rays started being used to treat skin
cancers. This image shows an x-ray of Rontgen's wife's hand. You can
see the bones in her hand as well as her wedding ring on her finger.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT04.png" alt="RT04.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Later in the 1900s, the first radiation delivery machines, called
linear accelerators, were developed. Then computed tomography, or CT
scans, were invented in 1971. These discoveries led to the invention
of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, or IMRT, in the early
1980s.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT05.png" alt="RT05.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The invention of IMRT significantly improved the ability of radiation
therapy to target cancerous cells. To reach the tumor, radiation
passes through healthy tissue and therefore damages both healthy and
cancerous tissue.
</p>

<p>
This damage to healthy tissue can lead to undesirable side effects
that reduce post-treatment quality of life.
</p>

<p>
For example, blistering and burning of skin can occur because of the
damage to healthy skin cells. For this reason, we want the dose to fit
the tumor as closely as possible to reduce the dose to healthy
tissue. This became possible with the invention of IMRT.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT06.png" alt="RT06.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In IMRT, the intensity profile of each beam is non-uniform. Before
IMRT, each beam had to have the same intensity, so the tumor could not
be targeted very well.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT07.png" alt="RT07.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But by using non-uniform intensity profiles, the radiation dose can
better fit the tumor. Let's see what this looks like.
</p>

<p>
In this image, we have a person's body outlined in black, and then the
target, or tumor, and two critical structures also outlined.
</p>

<p>
We would like to maximize the radiation to the target, while
minimizing the dose to healthy tissue, and especially to the critical
structures. Using traditional radiation therapy, each of the three
beams has the same intensity throughout the beam.
</p>

<p>
So to deliver enough radiation to the tumor, we also have to deliver a
significant amount of radiation to the critical structures and to
other healthy tissue.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT08.png" alt="RT08.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But by using IMRT, we can change the intensity throughout each beam to
make it non-uniform. Some pieces of the beam will have a higher
intensity than others.
</p>

<p>
This allows us to deliver the necessary amount of radiation to the
tumor, while minimizing the total radiation to healthy tissue, and
thus, the critical structures get significantly less radiation.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT09.png" alt="RT09.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Each of the pieces of the beam is referred to as a <b>beamlet</b>. So in
IMRT, we decide the intensity of each of the <b>beamlets</b> so that we can
target the tumor with radiation while minimizing the radiation to
healthy tissue.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT10.png" alt="RT10.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So in designing an IMRT treatment, the fundamental problem is &#x2013;
</p>

<p>
how should the beamlet intensities be selected to deliver a
therapeutic dose to the tumor and to minimize damage to healthy
tissue?

</ul>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
We get to decide the beamlet intensities - these will be the decision
variables in our optimization problem. The amount of radiation to the
tumor will be computed using the beamlet intensities, but we also want
to make sure we know the amount of radiation to healthy tissue. The
intensities of the beams would have been the decision variables in
traditional radiation therapy, and the shape of the tumor is data.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Video 2: An Optimization Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
We will discuss how radiation therapy can be framed as an optimization
problem. The data's collected in the treatment planning process, which
starts from a CT scan, like the one you see here, on the right.
</p>

<p>
Using a CT scan, a radiation oncologist contours, or draws outlines
around the tumor and various critical structures. In this image, the
oncologist would contour structures like the parotid glands, the
largest of the saliva glands, and the brain.
</p>

<p>
Then, each structure is discretized into voxels, or volume elements,
which are typically four millimeters in dimension.
</p>

<p>
The second image here shows a closer view of the brain. You can see
the small squares, or voxels. Here, they're two-dimensional, but in
reality they would be three-dimensional.
</p>

<p>
Now, we can compute how much dose each beamlet, or piece of the beam,
delivers to each voxel.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT12.png" alt="RT12.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We'll start with a small example. Suppose we have nine voxels and six
beamlets. Our voxels can be categorized into three types: the tumor
voxels, which are colored pink here; the spinal cord voxel, colored
dark green; and other healthy tissue voxels, colored light green.
</p>

<p>
So we have four tumor voxels, one spinal cord voxel, and four other
healthy tissue voxels.
</p>

<p>
We have two beams that are each split into three beamlets. Beam 1 is
composed of beamlets 1, 2, and 3, and comes in from the right. Beam 2
is composed of beamlets 4, 5, and 6, and comes in from the top.
</p>

<p>
Our objective is to <b>minimize</b> the total dose to healthy tissue, both
to the spinal cord and to the other healthy tissue.
</p>

<p>
We have two types of constraints. The first is that the dose to the
tumor voxels must be at least 7 Gray, which is the unit of measure for
radiation.
</p>

<p>
Our second constraint is that the dose to the spinal cord voxel can't
be more than 5 Gray, since we want to be careful to protect the spinal
cord.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT13.png" alt="RT13.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We know the dose that each beamlet gives to each voxel at unit
intensity. This table shows the dose that each beamlet in Beam 1 gives
to the voxels.
</p>

<p>
Remember that this is at unit intensity. If we double the intensity of
the beamlet, we double the doses.
</p>

<p>
The dose to each voxel can depend on how far the beamlet has to
travel, or the type of tissue that the beamlet has to travel through.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT14.png" alt="RT14.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, we know the dose that each beamlet in Beam 2 gives to each
voxel, again at unit intensity. The dose depends on the direction of
the beam and what it travels through.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT15.png" alt="RT15.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Putting these tables together, we can write out our optimization
problem. Our decision variables are the intensities of each beamlet.
</p>

<p>
We'll call them \(x_1\), the intensity for beamlet \(1\), \(x_2\), the
intensity for beamlet \(2\), \(x_3\), the intensity for beamlet 3, etc.,
all the way up through \(x_6\).
</p>

<p>
As we mentioned before, our objective is to minimize the total dose to
the healthy tissue, including the spinal cord.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So we want to minimize the total dose beamlets give to healthy
tissues.
</li>
<li>Now for our constraints. First, we need to make sure that each voxel
of the tumor gets a dose of at least 7.
</li>
<li>Then for the spinal cord, we need to make sure that do not receive
more that 5.
</li>
<li>Non-negativity constraints are important too.

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
Beamlet 1 hits one tumor voxel, and two healthy tissue voxels. At unit
intensity, it delivers a dose of 2 to the tumor voxel, a dose of 2 to
the first healthy tissue voxel, and a dose of 1 to the second healthy
tissue voxel. At intensity 3, this means that it will deliver a dose
of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) to the tumor voxel, and \(2 \times 3 + 1 \times 3 =
9\) to the healthy tissue voxels.

In this video, we'll be using the spreadsheet IMRT_SimpleExample. If
you are using LibreOffice or OpenOffice, please download and open the

</p>

<p>
We will solve our simple example in LibreOffice.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the spreadsheet, you should see our data. For each
beamlet and each voxel, we have the dose that that beamlet gives to
that voxel at unit intensity.
</p>

<p>
So we have this data for voxel one, voxel two, voxel three, all the
way up to voxel nine. Each row corresponds to one of the six
beamlets. This is the data that we saw on the slides in the previous
video.
</p>

<p>
Below the data, we've outlined our decision variables, which are the
intensities of the beamlets. So for beamlets one through six, we have
one decision variable. These six decision variables are outlined in
yellow.
</p>

<p>
Right now, the decision variable cells are blank, because the values
will be filled in by Solver.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/IMRT_Optimization.png" alt="IMRT_Optimization.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Below the decision variables, we have our objective. Our objective is
to minimize the total dose to healthy tissue. The healthy-tissue
voxels are voxels one, three, five, six, and nine.
</p>

<p>
So let's go ahead and build our objective in the blue cell here. So
first, we want to add up the total dose that each beamlet gives to
voxel one.
</p>

<p>
So here we will use the function that we used in the previous lecture,
<code>sumproduct</code>. So type an equals sign, and then <code>sumproduct</code>, and
select all of the decision variables, semicolon, and then all of the
doses.
</p>

<p>
This will add up the total dose that beamlet one gives to voxel one,
plus the total dose beamlet two gives to voxel one, plus the total
dose beamlet three gives to voxel one, etc. Now we want to repeat this
for voxels three, five, six, and nine&#x2013; the other healthy-tissue
voxels.
</p>

<p>
When Solver fills in our decision variables, our objective value will
be here.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/IMRT_OptimizationConstraints.png" alt="IMRT_OptimizationConstraints.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The remaining constraints we have are the non-negativity constraints,
which we'll add in directly in the Solver. So now go ahead and go to
the Tools menu, and select Solver.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/IMRT_OptimizationConstraints02.png" alt="IMRT_OptimizationConstraints02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the <code>Options</code>, make sure you've selected the Linear Solver, and
click OK. Now go ahead and hit Solve. You should see a solving result
that says: "Solving successfully finished. Result: \(22.75\).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/IMRT_OptimizationConstraints03.png" alt="IMRT_OptimizationConstraints03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
That's the optimal objective function value. Go ahead and select Keep
Result. Now let's take a look at our solution.
</p>

<p>
So the optimal solution is to have:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>beamlet one at an intensity 2.25,
</li>
<li>beamlet two at an intensity of 0,
</li>
<li>beamlet three at an intensity of 3,
</li>
<li>beamlet four at an intensity of 3.5,
</li>
<li>beamlet five at an intensity of 2.5,
</li>
<li>and beamlet six at an intensity of 0.
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/IMRT_OptimizationResults.png" alt="IMRT_OptimizationResults.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This makes sense, because beamlet two goes across the spinal cord, and
beamlet six only goes down healthy-tissue voxels.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT13.png" alt="RT13.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
And if we look at our constraints, we can double-check that each tumor
voxel is receiving a dose of at least 7 &#x2013; one tumor voxel gets a dose
of 8 &#x2013; and the spinal cord is receiving a dose of 5, which is the
maximum possible dose.

<h3 id="sec-2-7"><span class="section-number-3">2.7</span> Video 4: A Head and Neck Case</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
Now, let's take a look at a full example of a case. This is a head and
neck example, and the CT scans are shown on the right. There are a
total of 132,878 voxels. The target, or tumor, has 9,777 voxels.
</p>

<p>
There are five critical structures that we want to minimize the dose
to&#x2013; the spinal cord, the brain, the brain stem, the parotid glands,
and the mandible or jaw.
</p>

<p>
We're using five beams, and each beam is composed of about 60
beamlets. In total, there are 328 beamlets.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT17.png" alt="RT17.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In this example, we want the dose to the whole tumor to be between 70
and 77 gray. The spinal cord dose should be no more than 45 gray,
since significant damage to any voxel in the spinal cord will result
in loss of function.
</p>

<p>
The brain stem dose should be no more than 54 gray, and the mandible
dose should be no more than 70 gray. The average parotid gland dose
should be at most 26 gray. This constraint is a little different,
since the parotid gland is a parallel structure.
</p>

<p>
Significant damage to any one voxel does not jeopardize function of
the entire organ.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT18.png" alt="RT18.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>So what is our optimization problem now?</b> Again, our decisions are
the intensities of the beamlets. Our objective is to minimize the
total dose to healthy tissue.
</p>

<p>
Our constraints are limits on the tumor dose and upper bounds for the
spinal cord, brain stem, and mandible. We also have a constraint to
limit the average parotid dose to 26 gray.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, all of our intensities, or decision variables, should be
non-negative.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT19.png" alt="RT19.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We solved this optimization problem, and this plot shows the
results. On the x-axis is the dose, in gray, and on the y-axis is the
fraction of voxels that received that dose or higher.
</p>

<p>
Each line corresponds to a different structure. We can see that for
the tumor, which is shown as the red line, 100% of the voxels get a
dose of 70 gray, and 0% of the voxels get a dose of more than 77
gray. This is what our constraint specified.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT20.png" alt="RT20.png" />

<p>
While none of the critical structures are getting very high doses, it
looks like the mandible, which is shown as the blue line, is receiving
the highest dose of the healthy organs.

328 beamlets.
</p>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
Our decision variables are for the intensities of the beamlets. So in
this case, we would have 328 decision variables, which is the number
of beamlets.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-9"><span class="section-number-3">2.9</span> Video 5: Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<p>
In the previous video, we saw that the mandible, or jawbone, received
the highest dose out of all of the critical structures. The mean
mandible dose was 11.3 gray.
</p>

<p>
<b>So how can we reduce this?</b>
</p>

<p>
One approach is to modify our objective function. Our current
objective is to minimize the sum of the total dose to each critical
structure.
</p>

<p>
So we're minimizing the sum of the total dose to the brain, plus the
total dose to the brain stem, plus a total dose to the spinal cord,
plus the total dose to the parotid glands, plus the total dose to the
mandible.
</p>

<p>
We could instead change our objective to make the total dose to the
mandible more important. This can be done by weighting the term for
the mandible. By giving the mandible dose a weight of 10, the total
dose to the mandible becomes 10 times more important in our objective
than the total dose to the other critical structures.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT21.png" alt="RT21.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If we solve our problem with this new objective, we get the solution
shown in this figure. The dose to the tumor, shown as the red line,
does not change. It still stays within the constraints we've defined.
</p>

<p>
For each of the critical structures, the solution with the previous
objective is shown as a dotted line, and the new solution with the
weighted objective is shown as a solid line.
</p>

<p>
We can see that the dose to the mandible, shown in blue, has
significantly decreased by adding a weight in the objective.
</p>

<p>
However, the dose to other critical structures has increased,
especially to the parotid glands, shown in black, and to the spinal
cord, shown in green. This shows how you can modify the objective to
capture different trade-offs that might be desirable to different
decision-makers or for different patients.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT22.png" alt="RT22.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another way to explore trade-offs is to modify the constraints. For
example, by relaxing the mandible maximum dose constraint or by
allowing the maximum dose to the mandible to be higher, we may improve
our total healthy tissue dose.
</p>

<p>
We would like to know how much the objective changes for different
constraints.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT23.png" alt="RT23.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This can be answered by looking at the <b>shadow prices</b> of the
constraints. Recall that we have a constraint limiting the total dose
for each voxel in each critical structure.
</p>

<p>
This table shows the highest <b>shadow price</b> for any one voxel in each
critical structure. The parotid glands and the brain stem have shadow
prices of 0. This means that we're not even giving the maximum amount
of radiation allowed to these structures, so modifying the constraints
is not beneficial.
</p>

<p>
The spinal cord has a shadow price of 96.911. This means that by
increasing the radiation to one voxel of the spinal cord by one unit,
we can decrease the total radiation to other critical structures by
96.9 units. The mandible has the highest shadow price of 7,399.72.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT24.png" alt="RT24.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So if a slight increase in the mandible dose to a single voxel is
acceptable, the total healthy tissue dose can be reduced. Keep in mind
that this is the total reduction across all voxels in the
objective. We've seen in this video that by modifying the formulation,
both the objective and the constraints, we can explore different
trade-offs in our problem.

Radiation therapy is one of the most well used applications of
optimization in health care. In practice, radiation machines are
connected to treatment planning software that implements and solves
optimization models, both linear optimization models, like we saw
here, and other types of optimization models.
</p>

<p>
Some examples of radiation machines that use optimization software are
Pinnacle by Philips, RayStation by RaySearch Labs, and Eclipse by
Varian.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT25.png" alt="RT25.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
There are many extensions to the optimization model we described
here. One is the selection of beam angles. The beam angles can be
selected jointly with the intensity profiles by using integer
optimization.
</p>

<p>
This allows the treatment to be further personalized to the specific
tumor and person receiving the radiation.
</p>

<p>
Integer optimization is another type of optimization model and will be
the topic of next week. Another extension is accounting for
uncertainty. Often, the quality of IMRT treatments is degraded due to
uncertain organ motion.
</p>

<p>
For example, in lung cancer the target area is around the lungs. But
since the patient is breathing throughout the treatment, the target
area is moving and the location is slightly uncertain.
</p>

<p>
We can manage this uncertainty using a method known as <b>robust
optimization</b>. There is a significant amount of literature on this
method and its application to radiation therapy.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT26.png" alt="RT26.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Linear optimization</b> significantly improves the efficiency of
radiation therapy. Manually designing an IMRT treatment would be
inefficient and impractical.
</p>

<p>
By using linear optimization, IMRT can be designed in an efficient and
systematic way. As we saw in this lecture, clinical criteria can be
modeled using constraints, and the treatment planner can explore
trade-offs by changing the model.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT27.png" alt="RT27.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
But ultimately, <b>IMRT</b> and the use of optimization benefits the
patient. In head and neck cancers, saliva glands were rarely spared
prior to IMRT. But by using optimized IMRT treatments, saliva glands
can now be spared.
</p>

<p>
In prostate cancer, IMRT treatments reduce toxicities and allow for
higher tumor doses to be delivered safely.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RT28.png" alt="RT28.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
And in lung cancer, optimized IMRT reduced the risk of radiation
induced <b>pneumonitis</b>. These are just three examples of the benefits of
IMRT. Overall, optimized IMRT allows clinicians to deliver treatment
that was previously impossible and to improve the quality of life for
patients.

In this recitation, we'll be going over the basic steps in building,
solving, and analyzing a linear optimization model. The problem we
will use to demonstrate this comes from Google AdWords, which is the
advertising system used by Google.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G01.png" alt="G01.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's begin by talking a little bit about Google. As you may know,
Google is a major company in the United States that provides products
and services related to the internet.
</p>

<p>
Google's official mission statement is to organize the world's
information, and to make it universally accessible and
useful. Although Google today develops a variety of products that
includes things such as the Android operating system, the Google Glass
wearable computer, and even self-driving cars, Google became famous&#x2013;
and is still most widely known&#x2013; for its search engine, which can be
found at www.google.com.
</p>

<p>
The search engine lets the user enter a query. Google then searches
through the web pages accessible on the internet, to return links to
websites that best fit the search query.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G02.png" alt="G02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Now, how did Google come about?</b> Well, the idea of Google originated
as a research project of two people&#x2013; Sergey Brin and Larry Page.
</p>

<p>
This was in 1996, while they were still graduate students at Stanford
University. Their idea, in a nut shell, was to measure the importance
of a web page to a particular query, not just by measuring how much
that query occurs in that web page, but also by considering the links
to that web page from other web pages.
</p>

<p>
They quickly found that this idea could form the core of a search
engine, and they found that the search engine actually worked quite
well.
</p>

<p>
They eventually named it Google. And in 1998, they incorporated Google
as a company. In the same year, they received their first funding. At
the time, they had a database of 60 million web pages. Six years
later, Google's initial public offering took place, and Google became
a publicly traded company.
</p>

<p>
After going public, Google has continued to grow at an immense pace,
acquiring other internet companies like YouTube in 2007. In 2013,
Google's traffic reached more than a billion unique monthly visitors.
</p>

<p>
Today, more than two-thirds of all the searches done on the internet
are powered by Google's search engine. Now, you may be rather
surprised to hear that Google does not actually make any money
directly from its search engine. In fact, Google's search engine is
free for anyone to use.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G03.png" alt="G03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So then, <b>how does Google make money?</b> And the answer is &#x2013; through
online advertising.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Google sells space on its web pages&#x2013; in particular,
results of its search queries&#x2013; to outside companies. These companies
can then place advertisements, or ads, on these spaces.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G04.png" alt="G04.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's take a look at a concrete example. So here we have a screen shot
of the results of a Google search. The query here was "nine inch nails
tickets". Nine Inch Nails&#x2013; if you're not familiar with it&#x2013; is a
critically acclaimed industrial rock band from the United States, that
recently toured North America.
</p>

<p>
On this page, there are only two search results&#x2013; here and here. The
first is a link to Ticketmaster, which is a company that sells concert
tickets. The second is to the tour page of Nine Inch Nails' official
website.
</p>

<p>
All the remaining links on this web page are ads. In this case, these
are mostly links to other third-party companies that resell tickets.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G05.png" alt="G05.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, you may be asking, why do companies advertise with Google? Well,
there are several reasons. As you saw a few slides back, Google
receives a lot of internet traffic, as a lot of users conduct searches
on Google.
</p>

<p>
So an ad placed on Google could be seen by a very large number of
users. At the same time, Google's web pages&#x2013; and the ads in them&#x2013;
are formatted in a very clean, visually appealing way.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, companies that advertise with Google can select which queries
their ads will be displayed for. This is a very useful feature,
because a company can then target specific customers that they think
are likely to buy their product, or to use their service.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G06.png" alt="G06.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Google's online advertising system is known as AdWords and is
responsible for more than 97% percent of Google's revenues.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Video 2: How Online Advertising Works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The process by which Google determines which ads to display for which
queries consists of three key steps.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, Google runs an auction where advertisers place bids for
different queries that they want to display their ads on.
</li>

<li>Next, Google uses each bid in a metric known as the Quality Score,
which basically measures how well a particular ad fits a particular
query to decide a quantity known as the price-per-click. Google does
this for each advertiser and each query.
</li>

<li>Finally, and this is where optimization plays a key role, Google
decides how often to display each ad for each query.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This problem, as we'll see shortly, can be formulated as a linear
optimization model. Let's begin by thinking about the data that we
need for this model.
</p>

<p>
In particular, let's think about the price-per-click.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G07.png" alt="G07.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So as we just discussed, Google decides each advertiser's
price-per-click. The price-per-click is how much each advertiser pays
Google when a user clicks on the ad for that query.
</p>

<p>
Each advertiser also specifies a budget. This is the total amount of
money that the advertiser has available to pay for all the clicks on
their ad.
</p>

<p>
Every time a user clicks on the advertiser's ad, the advertiser's
budget is depleted by the price-per-click for that ad for that user's
query.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G08.png" alt="G08.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's illustrate this with a small example. So suppose that we are
Google, and three of the major wireless service providers in the
United States &#x2013; AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon &#x2013; come to us wanting to
place ads on three different search queries: query 1, which is "4G
LTE"; query 2, which is the "largest LTE"; and query 3, which is "best
LTE network".
</p>

<p>
If you're not familiar with these terms, 4G and LTE basically refer to
different standards of high speed wireless data communication.
</p>

<p>
The table here shows the <code>price-per-click</code> of each advertiser in each
query. So for example, this 10 here means that T-Mobile will pay
Google $10 every time a user searches for query 1 and clicks on
T-Mobile's advertisement. In this example, T-Mobile's budget is $100.
</p>

<p>
If T-Mobile begins advertising and by some point five people have
clicked on T-Mobile's ad when they search for "4G LTE", then T-Mobile
will need to pay five times $10, or a total of $50.
</p>

<p>
If T-Mobile's budget is $100, this means that T-Mobile is left with
$100 minus $50, for a remaining budget of $50.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G09.png" alt="G09.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, while the price-per-click is important to know, we must remember
that the price-per-click is exactly that, the price that the
advertiser pays to Google for a single click of a given ad, on a given
query.
</p>

<p>
This price is paid only if the user clicks on the ad. But typically,
the people who use Google search engine, who are you and me, will not
click on every ad that is shown to them.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we need a way to capture how often users click on ads. This
is where the idea of <code>click-through-rate</code> becomes useful.
</p>

<p>
The <code>click-through-rate</code> is the probability that a user clicks on an
advertiser's ad for a given query. You can also think of this as the
average number of clicks that we expect per user.
</p>

<p>
And this quantity is defined, as we said, per advertiser and per
query.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G10.png" alt="G10.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So to illustrate this, for the example that we just introduced a few
slides ago, suppose that we have the following click-through-rates.
</p>

<p>
The number 0.08 here means that there is an 8% chance that a user who
searches for best LTE network will click on AT&amp;T's ad if it is shown
to them. In terms of the number of users who click on an ad for a
given query, this means that for 50 users, if the click-through-rate
is 0.08, we expect to see 4 users clicking on the ad.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if there are a hundred users who view the ad and 8% of them
click on the ad, we expect to see eight users clicking on AT&amp;T's ad
for query 3.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G11.png" alt="G11.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the next video, we'll define additional data that we'll need to
formulate the problem. In particular, we will see how the
<code>click-through-rate</code> and the <code>price-per-click</code> can be combined
together to obtain a new quantity called the average price per
display. This derived quantity will form a crucial part of our linear
optimization model.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Video 3: Prices and Queries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
We introduced the concept of <code>price-per-click</code> and
<code>click-through-rate</code>. Once we know both of these quantities, we can
calculate the average price per display. This is simply the average
amount that an advertiser pays when a user is shown their ad.
</p>

<p>
We can compute this by multiplying the <code>price-per-click</code> with the
<code>click-through-rate</code>.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G12.png" alt="G12.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's go through an example to see how this works.
Suppose we have 10 users who search for "best LTE network".
Google decides to display Verizon's ad to all of them.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G13.png" alt="G13.png" />
</p>
</div>



<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G14.png" alt="G14.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We know that the <code>click-through-rate</code> for Verizon and for the "best
LTE network" query is 0.2, so only two users click on the ad.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G15.png" alt="G15.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Verizon must now pay the <code>price-per-click</code> for each of these
users. Since there were two clicks and each click costs $25, Verizon
must pay a total of $50 to Google.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G16.png" alt="G16.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If we consider how much Verizon paid to Google on average, per user,
or equivalently how much Verizon paid per display of the ad, we just
divide the total amount of $50 for the 10 users who saw the ad. Doing
this, we see that the average price per display was $5.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G17.png" alt="G17.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We could have obtained this amount in a simpler way. In particular, as
we defined in the previous slide, this turns out to be exactly the
same as the <code>price-per-click</code> multiplied by the <code>click-through-rate</code>.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G18.png" alt="G18.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
For our data then, to obtain the average price per display
we simply need to multiply the <code>price-per-click</code> table and the
<code>click-through-rate</code> tables together.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G19.png" alt="G19.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The result table is
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G20.png" alt="G20.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The last piece of data that we need before we can define our problem
is we need to know how popular the queries are. Obviously, Google does
not control how many times a search query will be searched because the
users are the ones who submit the queries.
</p>

<p>
However, Google does have an estimate of the number of times, on
average, the query will be requested over a given day.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G21.png" alt="G21.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
For the example that we have been building so far, let's suppose that
we expect to see "4G LTE" 140 times, "largest LTE" 80 times, and "best
LTE network" 80 times, as well.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G22.png" alt="G22.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We're now ready to start modeling this problem. The problem that we
will consider is this. How many times should Google display each ad
for each query, so as to maximize their total revenue?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G23.png" alt="G23.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-5"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> Video 4: Modeling the Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
So let's begin modeling this problem as a linear optimization
problem. In terms of the framework that we have seen in the lectures,
our objective is to maximize the revenue to Google.
</p>

<p>
Our decision is for each advertiser and each query to decide the
number of times that advertiser's ad will be displayed for that query.
</p>

<p>
Our constraints are of two types. Our first constraint is that the
average amount paid by each advertiser, based on the number of times
Google displays their ad for each query, cannot exceed the budget of
that advertiser.
</p>

<p>
Our second constraint is that the total number of ads we display for a
query cannot exceed our estimate of the number of requests that we
expect to see for that query.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G24.png" alt="G24.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's quickly review our problem data. We have the average price per
display for each advertiser and each query. We have the budget of each
advertiser. And we have estimates of the number of requests for each
query.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G25.png" alt="G25.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So, let's now think about how to model all the pieces of our
problem. First, how should we define our decision variables? Well, we
should define them for each advertiser and each query. So for example,
one of our decision variables will be \(x_{A1}\).
</p>

<p>
\(x_{A1}\) is the number of times we will display AT&amp;T's ad for
query 1. Similarly, we can define \(x_{A2}\) and \(x_{A3}\).
</p>

<p>
These are the numbers of times that we will display AT&amp;T's ad for
queries 2 and 3, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Now, of course, we have three different advertisers, so we will have
variables \(x_{T1}\), \(x_{T2}\), and \(x_{T3}\). These variables represent
the number of times that we display T-Mobile's ad for queries 1, 2,
and 3, respectively.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, our last advertiser's Verizon. At the same way.
</p>

<p>
Now, how do we compute the revenue to Google, <b>which is our
objective?</b> Well, we know the average price per display, and our
decision variables tell us exactly how many times we'll display each
ad for each query.
</p>

<p>
So all we need to do is we need to multiply each decision variable
with its corresponding average price per display and add them all up.
</p>

<p>
To get the constraints, we use a similar process. For instance, to get
how much AT&amp;T pays, we multiply the AT&amp;T variables by their average
prices per display and add them up. Now, one of our constraints, as
you will recall, is that this cannot exceed AT&amp;T's budget, which is
$170.
</p>

<p>
We can repeat this to get the same kind of budget constraint for
T-Mobile and Verizon. Now, to get the number of times query 2 is used,
we add up the decision variables corresponding to query 2.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/G26.png" alt="G26.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So we have \(x_{A2}\), the number of times AT&amp;T is paired with
query 2. We have \(x_{T2}\), which is the number of times T-Mobile is
paired with query 2, and \(x_{V2}\), which is the number of times
Verizon is paired with query 2.
</p>

<p>
Now, one of our constraints is that this cannot exceed the estimated
number of requests for query 2, which is 80.
</p>

<p>
We can do this for the other queries. So we can do this for query 1
and query 3. And this is all that we really need.
</p>

<p>
let's take this problem to LibreOffice and actually solve it.

In this video, we'll be using the spreadsheet GoogleAdWords_LO. If you
are using LibreOffice or OpenOffice, please download and open the
spreadsheet <a href="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/GoogleAdWords_LO.ods">GoogleAdWords_LO.ods</a> to follow along with this video. If
you are using Microsoft Excel, please download and open the
spreadsheet <a href="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/GoogleAdWords_LO.xlsx">GoogleAdWords_LO.xlsx</a> to follow along with this video. The
following spreadsheets provide the final model, as it is at the end of
the video: <a href="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/GoogleAdWords_LO_Complete.ods">GoogleAdWords_LO_Complete.ods</a> and
<a href="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/GoogleAdWords_LO_Complete.xlsx">GoogleAdWords_LO_Complete.xlsx</a>.

Here, we have a spreadsheet in LibreOffice that contains all of our
data. Up here, we have the basic data, which are the price-per-click
and click-through-rate.
</p>

<p>
Below, we have the average price per display, which we will actually
be using. Below it, we have the budgets, and below that we have the
query estimates. After the data, we then have the variables. So these
are the \(x_{A1}\) through \(x_{A3}\), the \(x_{T1}\) through \(x_{T3}\) and
the \(x_{V1}\) through \(x_{V3}\) that we saw in the previous video.
