* Judge, Jury, and Classifier: An Introduction to Trees

Supreme Court Building, and the United States Supreme Court Justices
all come from Wikimedia Commons.

*Introduction*

This seems like a very unconventional use of analytics, but in 2002 a
group of political science and law academics decided to test if a
model can do better than a group of experts at predicting the
decisions of the Supreme Court. In this case, a very interpretable
analytics method was used, called classification and regression
trees.

[[../graphs/AmericanLegalSystem.png]]

Cases start at the district courts, where an initial decision is made
about the case. The circuit courts hear appeals from the district
courts, and can change the decision that was made. The Supreme Court
is the highest level in the American legal system and makes the final
decision on cases.

[[../graphs/SupremeCourt.png]]

This image shows the nine Supreme Court justices from the time period
1994 through 2005. This was the longest period of time with the same
set of justices in over 180 years.

There have been many significant and groundbreaking decisions made by
the Supreme Court. These are a few notable decisions that were made.

[[../graphs/SCOTUS.png]]

In *1942*, the Supreme Court decided on the *Wickard v. Filburn*
case. This case recognized the power of the federal government to
regulate economic activity.

Filburn was a farmer, who was growing wheat for on-farm
consumption. However, the US had established limits on wheat
production, and Filburn was exceeding those limits. So even though the
extra wheat he was producing was for his own use and he had no
intention of selling it, he was forced to destroy it.

In *1973*, the Supreme Court decided on the *Roe v. Wade* case, one of the
most well-known cases to this day. They decided to legalize abortion,
and by doing this, prompted a national debate that continues today
about the legality of abortion.

In *2000*, the Supreme Court actually decided the outcome of the
presidential election. The race was so close in the state of Florida,
that a recount of the ballots was required. But the Florida Secretary
of State certified that President Bush was the winner before the
recount could be completed.

The case then went to the Supreme Court where it was ruled that all
ballots needed to be recounted. But since this could not be done
before the winner had to be declared, President Bush won the state of
Florida, and thus, the presidency.

A very recent case from *2012* dealt with the *Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act*, commonly called ObamaCare, which requires most
Americans to have health insurance. The Supreme Court upheld this
requirement.

[[../graphs/PredictingSCOTUS.png]]

Since non-profits, voters, and anybody interested in long-term
planning can benefit from knowing the outcomes of the Supreme Court
cases before they happen, legal academics and political scientists
regularly make predictions of Supreme Court decisions from detailed
studies of the cases and individual justices.

They wanted to see if an analytical model could outperform the
expertise and intuition of a large group of experts. Martin used a
method called classification and regression trees, or CART. In this
case, the outcome is binary.

[[../graphs/PredictingSCOTUS02.png]]

** Quick Question (1 point possible)

How much data do you think Andrew Martin should use to build his
model?

*** Answer

- [X] Information from all cases with the same set of justices as
  those he is trying to predict. Data from cases where the justices
  were different might just add noise to our problem.

- [ ] Only information from the most recent year. Since the justices
  change every year, only this information would be useful.

*Explanation*

Andrew Martin should use all data from the cases with the same set of
justices. The justices do not change every year, and typically you
want to use as much data as you have available.

** Video 2: CART

To predict the outcomes of the Supreme Court, Martin used cases from
1994 through 2001. He chose this period of time because the Supreme
Court was composed of the same nine justices that were justices when
he made his predictions in 2002.

[[../graphs/DataSCOTUS.png]]

This was a very rare data set, since as I mentioned earlier, this was
the longest period of time with the same set of justices in over 180
years. This allowed Martin to use a larger data set then might have
been available if he was doing this experiment at a different time.

[[../graphs/VariablesSCOTUS.png]]

- The *circuit court of origin* is the circuit or lower court where the
  case came from. There are 13 different circuit courts in the United
  States. The 1st through 11th and Washington, DC courts are defined
  by region. And the federal court is defined by the subject matter of
  the case.

- The *issue area of the case* gives each case a category, like civil
  rights or federal taxation.

- The *type of petitioner and type of respondent* define two parties
  in the case. Some examples are the United States, an employer, or an
  employee.

- The *ideological direction of the lower court decision* describes
  whether the lower court made what was considered a liberal or a
  conservative decision.

- The last variable indicates *whether or not the petitioner argued
  that a law or practice was unconstitutional*.

To collect this data, Martin and his colleagues read through all of
the cases and coded the information. Some of it, like the circuit
court, is straightforward. But other information required a judgment
call, like the ideological direction of the lower court.

*** Logistic regression interpretation issues

Now that we have our data and variables, we are ready to predict the
decisions of Justice Stevens.

[[../graphs/LRStevens.png]]

We can use logistic regression, and we get a model where some of the
most significant variables are:

whether or not the case is from the 2nd circuit court, with a
coefficient of 1.66; whether or not the case is from the 4th circuit
court, with a coefficient of 2.82; and whether or not the lower court
decision was liberal, with a coefficient of (negative) -1.22.

While this tells us that the case being from the 2nd or 4th circuit
courts is predictive of Justice Stevens reversing the case, and the
lower court decision being liberal is predictive of Justice Stevens
affirming the case, it's difficult to understand which factors are
more important due to things like the scales of the variables, and the
possibility of multicollinearity.

It's also difficult to quickly evaluate what the prediction would be
for a new case. So instead of logistic regression, Martin and his
colleagues used a method called *classification and regression trees*,
or *CART*.

*** CART

[[../graphs/CARTDef.png]]

This method builds what is called a tree by splitting on the values of
the independent variables. To predict the outcome for a new
observation or case, you can follow the splits in the tree and at the
end, you predict the most frequent outcome in the training set that
followed the same path.

Some advantages of CART are that it does not assume a linear model,
like logistic regression or linear regression, and it's a very
interpretable model.

*** Example

[[../graphs/CARTexample.png]]

This plot shows sample data for two independent variables, x and y,
and each data point is colored by the outcome variable, red or gray.

CART tries to split this data into subsets so that each subset is as
pure or homogeneous as possible. The first three splits that CART
would create are shown here. *Then the standard prediction made by a
CART model is just the majority in each subset*.

If a new observation fell into one of these two subsets (RED), then we
would predict red, since the majority of the observations in those
subsets are red.

However, if a new observation fell into one of these two subsets
(GRAY), we would predict gray, since the majority of the observations
in those two subsets are gray.

[[../graphs/CARTtreeExample.png]]

A CART model is represented by what we call a tree. The tree for the
splits we just generated is shown on the right. The first split tests
whether the variable x is less than 60.

If yes, the model says to predict red, and if no, the model moves on
to the next split. Then, the second split checks whether or not the
variable y is less than 20.

If no, the model says to predict gray, but if yes, the model moves on
to the next split. The third split checks whether or not the variable
x is less than 85.

If yes, then the model says to predict red, and if no, the model says
to predict gray. There are a couple things to keep in mind when
reading trees.

*Important*

There are a couple things to keep in mind when reading trees. In this
tree, and for the trees we'll generate in R, a yes response is always
to the left and a no response is always to the right. Also, make sure
you always start at the top of the tree. The x less than 85 split only
counts for observations for which x is greater than 60 and y is less
than 20.

** Quick Question (2 points possible)

Suppose that you have the following CART tree:

[[../graphs/QQ2_SupremeCourt.png]]

*** Question a

How many splits are in this tree?

**** Answer

*3 splits*.

*** Question b

For which data observations should we predict "Red", according to this
tree? Select all that apply.

**** Answer

- [X] If X is less than 60, and Y is any value.

- [ ] If X is greater than or equal to 60, and Y is greater than or
  equal to 20.

- [ ] If X is greater than or equal to 85, and Y is less than 20.

- [X] If X is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 85, and Y is
  less than 20.

*Explanation*

- This tree has three splits.

- The first split says to predict "Red" if X is less than 60,
  regardless of the value of Y.

- Otherwise, we move to the second split. The second split says to
  check the value of Y

    + if it is greater than or equal to 20, predict "Gray".

- Otherwise, we move to the third split. This split checks the value
  of X again.

    + If X is less than 85 (and greater than or equal to 60 by
       the first split) and Y is less than 20, then we predict
       "Red". Otherwise, we predict "Gray".

** Video 3: Splitting and Predictions

[[../graphs/NumberSplitsCART.png]]

In R, this is called the *minbucket* parameter, for the minimum number
of observations in each bucket or subset.

The smaller minbucket is, the more splits will be generated. But if
it's too small, overfitting will occur. This means that CART will fit
the training set almost perfectly. But this is bad because then the
model will probably not perform well on test set data or new data.

On the other hand, if the minbucket parameter is too large, the model
will be too simple and the accuracy will be poor.

*We will learn about a nice method for selecting the stopping
 parameter*.

[[../graphs/PredictionsCART.png]]

In the Supreme Court case, we'll be classifying observations as either
affirm or reverse. Instead of just taking the majority outcome to be
the prediction, we can compute the percentage of data in a subset of
each type of outcome.

As an example, if we have a subset with 10 affirms and two reverses,
then 87% of the data is affirm. Then, just like in logistic
regression, we can use a threshold value to obtain our prediction.

For this example, we would predict affirm with a threshold of 0.5
since the majority is affirm. But if we increase that threshold to
0.9, we would predict reverse for this example.

Then by varying the threshold value, we can compute an ROC curve and
compute an AUC value to evaluate our model.

[[../graphs/ROC-CART.png]]

**  Quick Question (1 point possible)

Suppose you have a subset of 20 observations, where 14 have outcome A
and 6 have outcome B. What proportion of observations have outcome A?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Proportion of observations of A:")
  A <- 14; B <- 6;
  A / (A + B)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Proportion of observations of A:
: [1] 0.7

*** Answer

*Explanation*

The fraction of observations that have outcome A is

$$
\frac{14}{14 + 6} = 0.7.
$$

** Quick Question (3 points possible)

The following questions ask about the subset of 20 observations from
the previous question.

*** Question

If we set the threshold to 0.25 when computing predictions of outcome
A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

**** Answer

- [X] A
- [ ] B

*** Question

If we set the threshold to 0.5 when computing predictions of outcome
A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

**** Answer

- [X] A
- [ ] B

*** Question

If we set the threshold to 0.75 when computing predictions of outcome
A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

**** Answer

- [ ] A
- [X] B

#+end_example

Now, let's take a look at our data using the ~str~ function. We have
566 observations, or Supreme Court cases, and nine different
variables.

*Docket* is just a unique identifier for each case, and *Term* is the
year of the case. Then we have our six independent variables: the *Circuit*
court of origin, the *Issue* area of the case, the type of
*Petitioner*, the type of *Respondent*, the lower court *LowerCourt*
direction, and whether or not the petitioner argued that a law or
practice was unconstitutional *Unconst*. The last variable is our
dependent variable, whether or not Justice Stevens voted to *reverse*
the case: 1 for reverse, and 0 for affirm.

Now before building models, we need to split our data into a training
set and a testing set.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Split the data:")
  library(caTools)
  set.seed(3000)

  spl <- sample.split(stevens$Reverse, SplitRatio = 0.7)
  Train <- subset(stevens, spl == TRUE)
  Test <- subset(stevens, spl == FALSE)

  writeLines("\n :: Dimensions of the training set:")
  dim(Train)

  writeLines("\n :: Dimensions of the testing set:")
  dim(Test)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Split the data:
:
:  :: Dimensions of the training set:
: [1] 396   9
:
:  :: Dimensions of the testing set:
: [1] 170   9

Now, we're ready to build our *CART* model. First we need to install and
load the ~rpart~ package and the ~rpart~ plotting package.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Install new package: rpart ...")
  ## install.packages('rpart', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')

  ## writeLines("\n :: Install new package: rpart.plot ...")
  ## install.packages('rpart.plot', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
  writeLines("\n :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...")

  writeLines("\n :: Loading rpart and rpart.plot...")
  library(rpart)
  library(rpart.plot)

  writeLines("\n :: rpart and r.part.plot libraries loaded...")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Install new package: rpart ...
:
:  :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...
:
:  :: Loading rpart and rpart.plot...
:
:  :: rpart and r.part.plot libraries loaded...

*** Building the CART model

Now we can create our CART model using the rpart function.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: CART model DONE...")
  StevensTree <- rpart(Reverse ~ Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +
              Respondent + LowerCourt + Unconst, data =
              Train, method = "class", minbucket = 25)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: CART model DONE...

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="CARTcourtModel" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  prp(StevensTree)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: CART model for the Stevens prediction.
#+NAME:   fig:CARTcourtModel
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/CARTcourtModel.png]]

The last argument we'll give is ~minbucket = 25~. This limits the tree
so that it doesn't overfit to our training set. We selected a value of
25, but we could pick a smaller or larger value.

If you're not sure what the abbreviations are, you could create a
table of the variable to see all of the possible values.

*** Making predictions in the testing set

Comparing this to a logistic regression model, we can see that it's
very interpretable. A CART tree is a series of decision rules which
can easily be explained. Now let's see how well our CART model does at
making predictions for the test set.

And we'll add a third argument here, which is ~type = "class"~. We
need to give this argument when making predictions for our CART model
if we want the majority class predictions. This is like using a
threshold of $0.5$.

We'll see in a few minutes how we can leave this argument out and
still get probabilities from our CART model.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Make predictions:")
  PredictCART <- predict(StevensTree, newdata = Test, type = "class")
  table(Test$Reverse, PredictCART)

  writeLines("\n :: Overall accuracy:")
  (41+71)/(41+36+22+71)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Make predictions:
:    PredictCART
:      0  1
:   0 41 36
:   1 22 71
:
:  :: Overall accuracy:
: [1] 0.6588235

Now let's compute the accuracy of our model by building a confusion
matrix. So we'll use the table function, and first give the true
outcome values-- ~Test$Reverse~, and then our predictions,
~PredictCART~.

So the accuracy of our CART model is $0.659$.

If you were to build a logistic regression model, you would get an
accuracy of 0.665 and a baseline model that always predicts Reverse,
the most common outcome, has an accuracy of 0.547. So our CART model
significantly beats the baseline and is competitive with logistic
regression.

Lastly, to evaluate our model, let's generate an ROC curve for our
CART model using the ROCR package.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: ROC curve:")
  library(ROCR)

  PredictROC <- predict(StevensTree, newdata = Test)
  head(PredictROC)

  pred <- prediction(PredictROC[,2], Test$Reverse)
  perf <- performance(pred, "tpr", "fpr")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: ROC curve:
:            0         1
: 1  0.3035714 0.6964286
: 3  0.3035714 0.6964286
: 4  0.4000000 0.6000000
: 6  0.4000000 0.6000000
: 8  0.4000000 0.6000000
: 21 0.3035714 0.6964286

*PredictROC*

For each observation in the test set, it gives two numbers which can
be thought of as the probability of outcome 0 and the probability of
outcome 1. More concretely, each test set observation is classified
into a subset, or bucket, of our CART tree.

These numbers give the percentage of training set data in that subset
with outcome 0 and the percentage of data in the training set in that
subset with outcome 1.

Now we need to use the performance function, where the first argument
is the outcome of the prediction function, and then the next two
arguments are true positive rate and false positive rate, what we want
on the x and y-axes of our ROC curve.

** Video 5: Random Forests

We'll introduce a method that is similar to CART called random
forests. This method was designed to improve the prediction accuracy
of CART and works by building a large number of CART
trees. Unfortunately, this makes the method less interpretable than
CART, so often you need to decide if you value the interpretability or
the increase in accuracy more.

To make a prediction for a new observation, each tree in the forest
votes on the outcome and we pick the outcome that receives the
majority of the votes.

[[../graphs/RandomForest.png]]

So how does random forests build many CART trees?

Random forests only allows each tree to split on a random subset of
the available independent variables, and each tree is built from what
we call a bagged or bootstrapped sample of the data. This just means
that the data used as the training data for each tree is selected
randomly with replacement.

[[../graphs/BuildingManyTrees.png]]

Suppose we have five data points in our training set. We'll call them
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For the first tree, we'll randomly pick five data
points randomly sampled with replacement.

So the data could be 2, 4, 5, 2, and 1. Each time we pick one of the
five data points regardless of whether or not it's been selected
already. These would be the five data points we would use when
constructing the first CART tree.

Then we repeat this process for the second tree. This time the data
set might be 3, 5, 1, 5, and 2. And we would use this data when
building the second CART tree. Then we would repeat this process for
each additional tree we want to create.

So *since each tree sees a different set of variables* and a different
set of data, we get what's called a *forest* of many different
trees. Just like CART, *random forests* has some parameter values that
need to be selected. The first is the minimum number of observations
in a subset, or the minbucket parameter from CART.

[[../graphs/RFParameters.png]]

When we create a random forest in R, this will be called *nodesize*. A
*smaller value of nodesize*, which *leads to bigger trees*, may take
longer in R. Random forests is much more computationally intensive
than CART. The second parameter is the number of trees to build, which
is called *ntree* in R. This should not be set too small, but the larger
it is the longer it will take. A couple hundred trees is typically
plenty. A nice thing about random forests is that it's not as
sensitive to the parameter values as CART is.

For random forests, as long as the selection is reasonable, it's OK.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Build random forest model:")

You should see an interesting warning message here. In CART, we added
the argument ~method = "class"~, so that it was clear that we're doing
a classification problem. As I mentioned earlier, trees can also be
used for regression problems, which you'll see in the recitation.

The randomForest function does not have a method argument. So when we
*want to do a classification problem*, we need to make sure *outcome
is a factor*. Let's convert the variable Reverse to a factor variable in
both our training and our testing sets.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all

So the accuracy of our Random Forest model is about $67\%$. Recall that
our logistic regression model had an accuracy of $66.5\%$ and our CART
model had an accuracy of $65.9\%$.

So our random forest model improved our accuracy a little bit over
CART. Sometimes you'll see a smaller improvement in accuracy and
sometimes you'll see that random forests can significantly improve in
accuracy over CART.

Keep in mind that Random Forests has a random component. You may have
gotten a different confusion matrix than me because there's a random
component to this method.

** QUICK QUESTION  (2 points possible)

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: When creating random forest models, you might still
get different answers from the ones you see here even if you set the
random seed. This has to do with different operating systems and the
random forest implementation.

Let's see what happens if we set the seed to two different values and
create two different random forest models.

exactly like we did in the previous video (Video 5). Then make

0.7058824

*EXPLANATION*

You can create the models and compute the accurracies with the
following commands in R:

~set.seed(100)~

~StevensForest = randomForest(Reverse ~ Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +~

~Respondent + LowerCourt + Unconst, data = Train, ntree=200, nodesize=25)~

~PredictForest = predict(StevensForest, newdata = Test)~

~table(Test$Reverse, PredictForest)~

and then repeat it, but with set.seed(200) first.

As we see here, the *random component* of the random forest method
*can change the accuracy*. The accuracy for a more stable dataset will not
change very much, but a noisy dataset can be significantly affected by
the random samples.

[[../graphs/ParameterSelectionCART.png]]

if minbucket is too small, over-fitting might occur. But if minbucket
is too large, the model might be too simple. So how should we set this
parameter value?

We could select the value that gives the best testing set accuracy,
but this isn't right. The idea of the testing set is to measure model
performance on data the model has never seen before.

By picking the value of *minbucket* to get the best test set
performance, the testing set was implicitly used to generate the
model.

Instead, we'll use a method called *K-fold Cross Validation*, which is
one way to properly select the parameter value.

This method works by going through the following steps:

*** First

We split the training set into k equally sized subsets, or folds. In
this example, k equals 5.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation.png]]

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation02.png]]

*** Second

Then we select $k - 1$, or four folds, to estimate the model, and
compute predictions on the remaining one fold, which is often referred
to as the validation set. We build a model and make predictions for
each possible parameter value we're considering.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation03.png]]

*** Third

Then we repeat this for each of the other folds, or pieces of our
training set. So we would build a model using folds 1, 2, 3, and 5 to
make predictions on fold 4.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation04.png]]

*** Fourth

And then we would build a model using folds 1, 2, 4, and 5 to make
predictions on fold 3, etc.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation05.png]]

So ultimately, cross validation builds many models, one for each fold
and possible parameter value.

*** Output K-Fold Cross Validation

This plot shows the possible parameter values on the x-axis, and the
accuracy of the model on the y-axis. This line shows the accuracy of
our model on fold 1. We can also compute the accuracy of the model
using each of the other folds as the validation sets.

[[../graphs/OutputK-FoldCrossValidation.png]]

We then average the accuracy over the k folds to determine the final
parameter value that we want to use. Typically, the behavior looks
like this-- if the parameter value is too small, then the accuracy is
lower, because the model is probably over-fit to the training set.

But if the parameter value is too large, then the accuracy is also
lower, because the model is too simple. In this case, we would pick a
parameter value around six, because it leads to the maximum average
accuracy over all parameter values.

[[../graphs/OutputK-FoldCrossValidation02.png]]

So far, we've used the parameter *minbucket* to limit our tree in
R. *When we use cross validation in R*, we'll use a parameter called
*cp* instead.

[[../graphs/CP-parameter.png]]

*A smaller cp value leads to a bigger tree*, so a smaller cp value might
*over-fit* the model to the training set. But a *cp value that's too
large* might build a model that's too simple.

*** Cross validation in R for the example of RF

First, we need to define how many folds we want. We can do this using
the ~trainControl~ function. So we'll say ~numFolds = trainControl~, and
then in parentheses, ~(method = "cv")~, for cross validation, and then
~number = 10~, for 10 folds.

Then we need to pick the possible values for our ~cp~ parameter, using
the ~expand.grid~ function. So we'll call it ~cpGrid~, and then use
~expand.grid~, where the only argument is ~.cp = seq(0.01, 0.5, 0.01)~. This
will define our ~cp~ parameters to test as numbers from 0.01 to 0.5, in
increments of 0.01.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Define cross-validation experiment:")

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.
The final value used for the model was cp = 0.19.
#+end_example

This is the cp value we want to use in our CART model. So now let's
create a new CART model with this value of cp, instead of the
minbucket parameter.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Create a new CART model:")
  StevensTreeCV <- rpart(Reverse ~ Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +
                                 Respondent + LowerCourt + Unconst, data
                         = Train, method="class", cp = 0.19)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Create a new CART model:

We'll call this model *StevensTreeCV*, and we'll use the rpart
function, like we did earlier, to predict Reverse using all of our
independent variables: Circuit, Issue, Petitioner, Respondent,
LowerCourt, and Unconst.

Our data set here is *Train*, and then we want method = "class",
since we're building a classification tree, and cp = 0.18.

Let's make predictions on our test set using this model.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Make predictions:")
  PredictCV <- predict(StevensTreeCV, newdata = Test, type = "class")

  table(Test$Reverse, PredictCV)
  writeLines("\n :: Calculate the overall accuracy:")
  (59 + 64)/(59 + 18 + 29 + 64)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Make predictions:
:    PredictCV
:      0  1
:   0 59 18
:   1 29 64
:
:  :: Calculate the overall accuracy:
: [1] 0.7235294

Remember that the accuracy of our previous CART model was
$0.659$. Cross validation helps us make sure we're selecting a good
parameter value, and often this will significantly increase the
accuracy.

If we had already happened to select a good parameter value, then the
accuracy might not of increased that much. But by using cross
validation, we can be sure that we're selecting a smart parameter
value.

** QUICK QUESTION  (1 point possible)

Plot the tree that we created using cross-validation. How many splits
does it have?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="CARTcourtModelCV" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  prp(StevensTreeCV)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: CART model for the Stevens prediction with Cross Validation.
#+NAME:   fig:CARTcourtModelCV
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]

*EXPLANATION*

If you follow the R commands from the previous video, you can plot the
tree with ~prp(StevensTreeCV)~.

The tree with the best accuracy only has one split! When we were
picking different minbucket parameters before, it seemed like this
tree was probably not doing a good job of fitting the data. However,
this tree with one split gives us the best out-of-sample
accuracy. This reminds us that sometimes the simplest models are the
best!
