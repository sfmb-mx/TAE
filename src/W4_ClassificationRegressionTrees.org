* Judge, Jury, and Classifier: An Introduction to Trees

Supreme Court Building, and the United States Supreme Court Justices
all come from Wikimedia Commons.

*Introduction*

This seems like a very unconventional use of analytics, but in 2002 a
group of political science and law academics decided to test if a
model can do better than a group of experts at predicting the
decisions of the Supreme Court. In this case, a very interpretable
analytics method was used, called classification and regression
trees.

[[../graphs/AmericanLegalSystem.png]]

Cases start at the district courts, where an initial decision is made
about the case. The circuit courts hear appeals from the district
courts, and can change the decision that was made. The Supreme Court
is the highest level in the American legal system and makes the final
decision on cases.

[[../graphs/SupremeCourt.png]]

This image shows the nine Supreme Court justices from the time period
1994 through 2005. This was the longest period of time with the same
set of justices in over 180 years.

There have been many significant and groundbreaking decisions made by
the Supreme Court. These are a few notable decisions that were made.

[[../graphs/SCOTUS.png]]

In *1942*, the Supreme Court decided on the *Wickard v. Filburn*
case. This case recognized the power of the federal government to
regulate economic activity.

Filburn was a farmer, who was growing wheat for on-farm
consumption. However, the US had established limits on wheat
production, and Filburn was exceeding those limits. So even though the
extra wheat he was producing was for his own use and he had no
intention of selling it, he was forced to destroy it.

In *1973*, the Supreme Court decided on the *Roe v. Wade* case, one of the
most well-known cases to this day. They decided to legalize abortion,
and by doing this, prompted a national debate that continues today
about the legality of abortion.

In *2000*, the Supreme Court actually decided the outcome of the
presidential election. The race was so close in the state of Florida,
that a recount of the ballots was required. But the Florida Secretary
of State certified that President Bush was the winner before the
recount could be completed.

The case then went to the Supreme Court where it was ruled that all
ballots needed to be recounted. But since this could not be done
before the winner had to be declared, President Bush won the state of
Florida, and thus, the presidency.

A very recent case from *2012* dealt with the *Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act*, commonly called ObamaCare, which requires most
Americans to have health insurance. The Supreme Court upheld this
requirement.

[[../graphs/PredictingSCOTUS.png]]

Since non-profits, voters, and anybody interested in long-term
planning can benefit from knowing the outcomes of the Supreme Court
cases before they happen, legal academics and political scientists
regularly make predictions of Supreme Court decisions from detailed
studies of the cases and individual justices.

They wanted to see if an analytical model could outperform the
expertise and intuition of a large group of experts. Martin used a
method called classification and regression trees, or CART. In this
case, the outcome is binary.

[[../graphs/PredictingSCOTUS02.png]]

** Quick Question (1 point possible)

How much data do you think Andrew Martin should use to build his
model?

*** Answer

- [X] Information from all cases with the same set of justices as
  those he is trying to predict. Data from cases where the justices
  were different might just add noise to our problem.

- [ ] Only information from the most recent year. Since the justices
  change every year, only this information would be useful.

*Explanation*

Andrew Martin should use all data from the cases with the same set of
justices. The justices do not change every year, and typically you
want to use as much data as you have available.

** Video 2: CART

To predict the outcomes of the Supreme Court, Martin used cases from
1994 through 2001. He chose this period of time because the Supreme
Court was composed of the same nine justices that were justices when
he made his predictions in 2002.

[[../graphs/DataSCOTUS.png]]

This was a very rare data set, since as I mentioned earlier, this was
the longest period of time with the same set of justices in over 180
years. This allowed Martin to use a larger data set then might have
been available if he was doing this experiment at a different time.

[[../graphs/VariablesSCOTUS.png]]

- The *circuit court of origin* is the circuit or lower court where the
  case came from. There are 13 different circuit courts in the United
  States. The 1st through 11th and Washington, DC courts are defined
  by region. And the federal court is defined by the subject matter of
  the case.

- The *issue area of the case* gives each case a category, like civil
  rights or federal taxation.

- The *type of petitioner and type of respondent* define two parties
  in the case. Some examples are the United States, an employer, or an
  employee.

- The *ideological direction of the lower court decision* describes
  whether the lower court made what was considered a liberal or a
  conservative decision.

- The last variable indicates *whether or not the petitioner argued
  that a law or practice was unconstitutional*.

To collect this data, Martin and his colleagues read through all of
the cases and coded the information. Some of it, like the circuit
court, is straightforward. But other information required a judgment
call, like the ideological direction of the lower court.

*** Logistic regression interpretation issues

Now that we have our data and variables, we are ready to predict the
decisions of Justice Stevens.

[[../graphs/LRStevens.png]]

We can use logistic regression, and we get a model where some of the
most significant variables are:

whether or not the case is from the 2nd circuit court, with a
coefficient of 1.66; whether or not the case is from the 4th circuit
court, with a coefficient of 2.82; and whether or not the lower court
decision was liberal, with a coefficient of (negative) -1.22.

While this tells us that the case being from the 2nd or 4th circuit
courts is predictive of Justice Stevens reversing the case, and the
lower court decision being liberal is predictive of Justice Stevens
affirming the case, it's difficult to understand which factors are
more important due to things like the scales of the variables, and the
possibility of multicollinearity.

It's also difficult to quickly evaluate what the prediction would be
for a new case. So instead of logistic regression, Martin and his
colleagues used a method called *classification and regression trees*,
or *CART*.

*** CART

[[../graphs/CARTDef.png]]

This method builds what is called a tree by splitting on the values of
the independent variables. To predict the outcome for a new
observation or case, you can follow the splits in the tree and at the
end, you predict the most frequent outcome in the training set that
followed the same path.

Some advantages of CART are that it does not assume a linear model,
like logistic regression or linear regression, and it's a very
interpretable model.

*** Example

[[../graphs/CARTexample.png]]

This plot shows sample data for two independent variables, x and y,
and each data point is colored by the outcome variable, red or gray.

CART tries to split this data into subsets so that each subset is as
pure or homogeneous as possible. The first three splits that CART
would create are shown here. *Then the standard prediction made by a
CART model is just the majority in each subset*.

If a new observation fell into one of these two subsets (RED), then we
would predict red, since the majority of the observations in those
subsets are red.

However, if a new observation fell into one of these two subsets
(GRAY), we would predict gray, since the majority of the observations
in those two subsets are gray.

[[../graphs/CARTtreeExample.png]]

A CART model is represented by what we call a tree. The tree for the
splits we just generated is shown on the right. The first split tests
whether the variable x is less than 60.

If yes, the model says to predict red, and if no, the model moves on
to the next split. Then, the second split checks whether or not the
variable y is less than 20.

If no, the model says to predict gray, but if yes, the model moves on
to the next split. The third split checks whether or not the variable
x is less than 85.

If yes, then the model says to predict red, and if no, the model says
to predict gray. There are a couple things to keep in mind when
reading trees.

*Important*

There are a couple things to keep in mind when reading trees. In this
tree, and for the trees we'll generate in R, a yes response is always
to the left and a no response is always to the right. Also, make sure
you always start at the top of the tree. The x less than 85 split only
counts for observations for which x is greater than 60 and y is less
than 20.

** Quick Question (2 points possible)

Suppose that you have the following CART tree:

[[../graphs/QQ2_SupremeCourt.png]]

*** Question a

How many splits are in this tree?

**** Answer

*3 splits*.

*** Question b

For which data observations should we predict "Red", according to this
tree? Select all that apply.

**** Answer

- [X] If X is less than 60, and Y is any value.

- [ ] If X is greater than or equal to 60, and Y is greater than or
  equal to 20.

- [ ] If X is greater than or equal to 85, and Y is less than 20.

- [X] If X is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 85, and Y is
  less than 20.

*Explanation*

- This tree has three splits.

- The first split says to predict "Red" if X is less than 60,
  regardless of the value of Y.

- Otherwise, we move to the second split. The second split says to
  check the value of Y

    + if it is greater than or equal to 20, predict "Gray".

- Otherwise, we move to the third split. This split checks the value
  of X again.

    + If X is less than 85 (and greater than or equal to 60 by
       the first split) and Y is less than 20, then we predict
       "Red". Otherwise, we predict "Gray".

** Video 3: Splitting and Predictions

[[../graphs/NumberSplitsCART.png]]

In R, this is called the *minbucket* parameter, for the minimum number
of observations in each bucket or subset.

The smaller minbucket is, the more splits will be generated. But if
it's too small, overfitting will occur. This means that CART will fit
the training set almost perfectly. But this is bad because then the
model will probably not perform well on test set data or new data.

On the other hand, if the minbucket parameter is too large, the model
will be too simple and the accuracy will be poor.

*We will learn about a nice method for selecting the stopping
 parameter*.

[[../graphs/PredictionsCART.png]]

In the Supreme Court case, we'll be classifying observations as either
affirm or reverse. Instead of just taking the majority outcome to be
the prediction, we can compute the percentage of data in a subset of
each type of outcome.

As an example, if we have a subset with 10 affirms and two reverses,
then 87% of the data is affirm. Then, just like in logistic
regression, we can use a threshold value to obtain our prediction.

For this example, we would predict affirm with a threshold of 0.5
since the majority is affirm. But if we increase that threshold to
0.9, we would predict reverse for this example.

Then by varying the threshold value, we can compute an ROC curve and
compute an AUC value to evaluate our model.

[[../graphs/ROC-CART.png]]

**  Quick Question (1 point possible)

Suppose you have a subset of 20 observations, where 14 have outcome A
and 6 have outcome B. What proportion of observations have outcome A?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Proportion of observations of A:")
  A <- 14; B <- 6;
  A / (A + B)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Proportion of observations of A:
: [1] 0.7

*** Answer

*Explanation*

The fraction of observations that have outcome A is

$$
\frac{14}{14 + 6} = 0.7.
$$

** Quick Question (3 points possible)

The following questions ask about the subset of 20 observations from
the previous question.

*** Question

If we set the threshold to 0.25 when computing predictions of outcome
A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

**** Answer

- [X] A
- [ ] B

*** Question

If we set the threshold to 0.5 when computing predictions of outcome
A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

**** Answer

- [X] A
- [ ] B

*** Question

If we set the threshold to 0.75 when computing predictions of outcome
A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

**** Answer

- [ ] A
- [X] B

#+end_example

Now, let's take a look at our data using the ~str~ function. We have
566 observations, or Supreme Court cases, and nine different
variables.

*Docket* is just a unique identifier for each case, and *Term* is the
year of the case. Then we have our six independent variables: the *Circuit*
court of origin, the *Issue* area of the case, the type of
*Petitioner*, the type of *Respondent*, the lower court *LowerCourt*
direction, and whether or not the petitioner argued that a law or
practice was unconstitutional *Unconst*. The last variable is our
dependent variable, whether or not Justice Stevens voted to *reverse*
the case: 1 for reverse, and 0 for affirm.

Now before building models, we need to split our data into a training
set and a testing set.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Split the data:")
  library(caTools)
  set.seed(3000)

  spl <- sample.split(stevens$Reverse, SplitRatio = 0.7)
  Train <- subset(stevens, spl == TRUE)
  Test <- subset(stevens, spl == FALSE)

  writeLines("\n :: Dimensions of the training set:")
  dim(Train)

  writeLines("\n :: Dimensions of the testing set:")
  dim(Test)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Split the data:
:
:  :: Dimensions of the training set:
: [1] 396   9
:
:  :: Dimensions of the testing set:
: [1] 170   9

Now, we're ready to build our *CART* model. First we need to install and
load the ~rpart~ package and the ~rpart~ plotting package.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Install new package: rpart ...")
  ## install.packages('rpart', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')

  ## writeLines("\n :: Install new package: rpart.plot ...")
  ## install.packages('rpart.plot', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
  writeLines("\n :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...")

  writeLines("\n :: Loading rpart and rpart.plot...")
  library(rpart)
  library(rpart.plot)

  writeLines("\n :: rpart and r.part.plot libraries loaded...")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Install new package: rpart ...
:
:  :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...
:
:  :: Loading rpart and rpart.plot...
:
:  :: rpart and r.part.plot libraries loaded...

*** Building the CART model

Now we can create our CART model using the rpart function.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: CART model DONE...")
  StevensTree <- rpart(Reverse ~ Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +
              Respondent + LowerCourt + Unconst, data =
              Train, method = "class", minbucket = 25)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: CART model DONE...

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="CARTcourtModel" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  prp(StevensTree)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: CART model for the Stevens prediction.
#+NAME:   fig:CARTcourtModel
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/CARTcourtModel.png]]

The last argument we'll give is ~minbucket = 25~. This limits the tree
so that it doesn't overfit to our training set. We selected a value of
25, but we could pick a smaller or larger value.

If you're not sure what the abbreviations are, you could create a
table of the variable to see all of the possible values.

*** Making predictions in the testing set

Comparing this to a logistic regression model, we can see that it's
very interpretable. A CART tree is a series of decision rules which
can easily be explained. Now let's see how well our CART model does at
making predictions for the test set.

And we'll add a third argument here, which is ~type = "class"~. We
need to give this argument when making predictions for our CART model
if we want the majority class predictions. This is like using a
threshold of $0.5$.

We'll see in a few minutes how we can leave this argument out and
still get probabilities from our CART model.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Make predictions:")
  PredictCART <- predict(StevensTree, newdata = Test, type = "class")
  table(Test$Reverse, PredictCART)

  writeLines("\n :: Overall accuracy:")
  (41+71)/(41+36+22+71)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Make predictions:
:    PredictCART
:      0  1
:   0 41 36
:   1 22 71
:
:  :: Overall accuracy:
: [1] 0.6588235

Now let's compute the accuracy of our model by building a confusion
matrix. So we'll use the table function, and first give the true
outcome values-- ~Test$Reverse~, and then our predictions,
~PredictCART~.

So the accuracy of our CART model is $0.659$.

If you were to build a logistic regression model, you would get an
accuracy of 0.665 and a baseline model that always predicts Reverse,
the most common outcome, has an accuracy of 0.547. So our CART model
significantly beats the baseline and is competitive with logistic
regression.

Lastly, to evaluate our model, let's generate an ROC curve for our
CART model using the ROCR package.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: ROC curve:")
  library(ROCR)

  PredictROC <- predict(StevensTree, newdata = Test)
  head(PredictROC)

  pred <- prediction(PredictROC[,2], Test$Reverse)
  perf <- performance(pred, "tpr", "fpr")
#+end_src

*PredictROC*

For each observation in the test set, it gives two numbers which can
be thought of as the probability of outcome 0 and the probability of
outcome 1. More concretely, each test set observation is classified
into a subset, or bucket, of our CART tree.

These numbers give the percentage of training set data in that subset
with outcome 0 and the percentage of data in the training set in that
subset with outcome 1.

Now we need to use the performance function, where the first argument
is the outcome of the prediction function, and then the next two
arguments are true positive rate and false positive rate, what we want
on the x and y-axes of our ROC curve.

We'll introduce a method that is similar to CART called random
forests. This method was designed to improve the prediction accuracy
of CART and works by building a large number of CART
trees. Unfortunately, this makes the method less interpretable than
CART, so often you need to decide if you value the interpretability or
the increase in accuracy more.

To make a prediction for a new observation, each tree in the forest
votes on the outcome and we pick the outcome that receives the
majority of the votes.

[[../graphs/RandomForest.png]]

So how does random forests build many CART trees?

Random forests only allows each tree to split on a random subset of
the available independent variables, and each tree is built from what
we call a bagged or bootstrapped sample of the data. This just means
that the data used as the training data for each tree is selected
randomly with replacement.

[[../graphs/BuildingManyTrees.png]]

Suppose we have five data points in our training set. We'll call them
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For the first tree, we'll randomly pick five data
points randomly sampled with replacement.

So the data could be 2, 4, 5, 2, and 1. Each time we pick one of the
five data points regardless of whether or not it's been selected
already. These would be the five data points we would use when
constructing the first CART tree.

Then we repeat this process for the second tree. This time the data
set might be 3, 5, 1, 5, and 2. And we would use this data when
building the second CART tree. Then we would repeat this process for
each additional tree we want to create.

So *since each tree sees a different set of variables* and a different
set of data, we get what's called a *forest* of many different
trees. Just like CART, *random forests* has some parameter values that
need to be selected. The first is the minimum number of observations
in a subset, or the minbucket parameter from CART.

[[../graphs/RFParameters.png]]

When we create a random forest in R, this will be called *nodesize*. A
*smaller value of nodesize*, which *leads to bigger trees*, may take
longer in R. Random forests is much more computationally intensive
than CART. The second parameter is the number of trees to build, which
is called *ntree* in R. This should not be set too small, but the larger
it is the longer it will take. A couple hundred trees is typically
plenty. A nice thing about random forests is that it's not as
sensitive to the parameter values as CART is.

For random forests, as long as the selection is reasonable, it's OK.

You should see an interesting warning message here. In CART, we added
the argument ~method = "class"~, so that it was clear that we're doing
a classification problem. As I mentioned earlier, trees can also be
used for regression problems, which you'll see in the recitation.

The randomForest function does not have a method argument. So when we
*want to do a classification problem*, we need to make sure *outcome
is a factor*. Let's convert the variable Reverse to a factor variable in
both our training and our testing sets.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all

So the accuracy of our Random Forest model is about $67\%$. Recall that
our logistic regression model had an accuracy of $66.5\%$ and our CART
model had an accuracy of $65.9\%$.

So our random forest model improved our accuracy a little bit over
CART. Sometimes you'll see a smaller improvement in accuracy and
sometimes you'll see that random forests can significantly improve in
accuracy over CART.

Keep in mind that Random Forests has a random component. You may have
gotten a different confusion matrix than me because there's a random
component to this method.

** QUICK QUESTION  (2 points possible)

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: When creating random forest models, you might still
get different answers from the ones you see here even if you set the
random seed. This has to do with different operating systems and the
random forest implementation.

Let's see what happens if we set the seed to two different values and
create two different random forest models.

*EXPLANATION*

You can create the models and compute the accurracies with the
following commands in R:

~set.seed(100)~

~StevensForest = randomForest(Reverse ~ Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +~

~Respondent + LowerCourt + Unconst, data = Train, ntree=200, nodesize=25)~

~PredictForest = predict(StevensForest, newdata = Test)~

~table(Test$Reverse, PredictForest)~

and then repeat it, but with set.seed(200) first.

As we see here, the *random component* of the random forest method
*can change the accuracy*. The accuracy for a more stable dataset will not
change very much, but a noisy dataset can be significantly affected by
the random samples.

[[../graphs/ParameterSelectionCART.png]]

if minbucket is too small, over-fitting might occur. But if minbucket
is too large, the model might be too simple. So how should we set this
parameter value?

We could select the value that gives the best testing set accuracy,
but this isn't right. The idea of the testing set is to measure model
performance on data the model has never seen before.

By picking the value of *minbucket* to get the best test set
performance, the testing set was implicitly used to generate the
model.

Instead, we'll use a method called *K-fold Cross Validation*, which is
one way to properly select the parameter value.

This method works by going through the following steps:

*** First

We split the training set into k equally sized subsets, or folds. In
this example, k equals 5.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation.png]]

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation02.png]]

*** Second

Then we select $k - 1$, or four folds, to estimate the model, and
compute predictions on the remaining one fold, which is often referred
to as the validation set. We build a model and make predictions for
each possible parameter value we're considering.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation03.png]]

*** Third

Then we repeat this for each of the other folds, or pieces of our
training set. So we would build a model using folds 1, 2, 3, and 5 to
make predictions on fold 4.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation04.png]]

*** Fourth

And then we would build a model using folds 1, 2, 4, and 5 to make
predictions on fold 3, etc.

[[../graphs/K-FoldCrossValidation05.png]]

So ultimately, cross validation builds many models, one for each fold
and possible parameter value.

*** Output K-Fold Cross Validation

This plot shows the possible parameter values on the x-axis, and the
accuracy of the model on the y-axis. This line shows the accuracy of
our model on fold 1. We can also compute the accuracy of the model
using each of the other folds as the validation sets.

[[../graphs/OutputK-FoldCrossValidation.png]]

We then average the accuracy over the k folds to determine the final
parameter value that we want to use. Typically, the behavior looks
like this-- if the parameter value is too small, then the accuracy is
lower, because the model is probably over-fit to the training set.

But if the parameter value is too large, then the accuracy is also
lower, because the model is too simple. In this case, we would pick a
parameter value around six, because it leads to the maximum average
accuracy over all parameter values.

[[../graphs/OutputK-FoldCrossValidation02.png]]

So far, we've used the parameter *minbucket* to limit our tree in
R. *When we use cross validation in R*, we'll use a parameter called
*cp* instead.

[[../graphs/CP-parameter.png]]

*A smaller cp value leads to a bigger tree*, so a smaller cp value might
*over-fit* the model to the training set. But a *cp value that's too
large* might build a model that's too simple.

*** Cross validation in R for the example of RF

First, we need to define how many folds we want. We can do this using
the ~trainControl~ function. So we'll say ~numFolds = trainControl~, and
then in parentheses, ~(method = "cv")~, for cross validation, and then
~number = 10~, for 10 folds.

Then we need to pick the possible values for our ~cp~ parameter, using
the ~expand.grid~ function. So we'll call it ~cpGrid~, and then use
~expand.grid~, where the only argument is ~.cp = seq(0.01, 0.5, 0.01)~. This
will define our ~cp~ parameters to test as numbers from 0.01 to 0.5, in
increments of 0.01.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Define cross-validation experiment:")

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.
The final value used for the model was cp = 0.19.
#+end_example

This is the cp value we want to use in our CART model. So now let's
create a new CART model with this value of cp, instead of the
minbucket parameter.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Create a new CART model:")
  StevensTreeCV <- rpart(Reverse ~ Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +
                                 Respondent + LowerCourt + Unconst, data
                         = Train, method="class", cp = 0.19)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Create a new CART model:

We'll call this model *StevensTreeCV*, and we'll use the rpart
function, like we did earlier, to predict Reverse using all of our
independent variables: Circuit, Issue, Petitioner, Respondent,
LowerCourt, and Unconst.

Our data set here is *Train*, and then we want method = "class",
since we're building a classification tree, and cp = 0.18.

Let's make predictions on our test set using this model.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Make predictions:")
  PredictCV <- predict(StevensTreeCV, newdata = Test, type = "class")

  table(Test$Reverse, PredictCV)
  writeLines("\n :: Calculate the overall accuracy:")
  (59 + 64)/(59 + 18 + 29 + 64)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Make predictions:
:    PredictCV
:      0  1
:   0 59 18
:   1 29 64
:
:  :: Calculate the overall accuracy:
: [1] 0.7235294

Remember that the accuracy of our previous CART model was
$0.659$. Cross validation helps us make sure we're selecting a good
parameter value, and often this will significantly increase the
accuracy.

If we had already happened to select a good parameter value, then the
accuracy might not of increased that much. But by using cross
validation, we can be sure that we're selecting a smart parameter
value.

** QUICK QUESTION  (1 point possible)

Plot the tree that we created using cross-validation. How many splits
does it have?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="CARTcourtModelCV" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  prp(StevensTreeCV)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: CART model for the Stevens prediction with Cross Validation.
#+NAME:   fig:CARTcourtModelCV
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/CARTcourtModelCV.png]]

*EXPLANATION*

If you follow the R commands from the previous video, you can plot the
tree with ~prp(StevensTreeCV)~.

The tree with the best accuracy only has one split! When we were
picking different minbucket parameters before, it seemed like this
tree was probably not doing a good job of fitting the data. However,
this tree with one split gives us the best out-of-sample
accuracy. This reminds us that sometimes the simplest models are the
best!

** Video 7: The Model V. The Experts

Can a CART model actually predict Supreme Court case outcomes better
than a group of experts? Martin and his colleagues used 628 previous
Supreme Court cases between 1994 and 2001 to build their model. They
made predictions for the 68 cases that would be decided in October,
2002, before the term started.

[[../graphs/Martin_sModel.png]]

Their model had two stages of CART trees. The first stage involved
making predictions using two CART trees. One to predict a unanimous
liberal decision and one to predict a unanimous conservative decision.

If the trees gave conflicting responses or both predicted no, then
they moved on to the next stage. It turns out that about 50% of
Supreme Court cases result in a unanimous decision, so this was a nice
first step to detect the easier cases.

The second stage consisted of predicting the decision of each
individual justice, and then use the majority decision of all nine
justices as a final prediction for the case.

Here's a different tree, this one for Justice O'Connor. The first
split is whether or not the lower court decision is liberal. If yes,
then we predict that she will reverse the case. This makes sense
because Justice O'Connor is generally viewed as a conservative judge.

On the other hand, if the lower court decision is conservative, we
check for the circuit court of origin. We predict that she will affirm
the case. If it's not one of these courts, we move on to the next
split. The remaining two splits are for the respondent and the primary
issue.

[[../graphs/OConnor.png]]

Here's another tree, this one for Justice Souter. This shows an
unusual property of the CART trees that Martin and his colleagues
developed. They use predictions for some trees as independent
variables for other trees.

In this tree, the first split is whether or not Justice Ginsburg's
predicted decision is liberal. So we have to run Justice Ginsburg's
CART tree first, see what the prediction is, and then use that as
input for Justice Souter's tree.

[[../graphs/Souter.png]]

If Justice Ginsburg's predicted decision is liberal and the lower
court decision is liberal, then we predict that Justice Souter will
affirm the case. But if the lower court decision is conservative, then
we predict that Justice Souter will reverse the case.

On the other side of the tree, if Justice Ginsburg's predicted
decision is conservative, but the lower court decision is liberal,
then we predict that Justice Souter will reverse the case. But if the
lower court decision is conservative, then we predict that Justice
Souter will affirm the case.

In summary, if we predict that Justice Ginsburg will make a liberal
decision, then Justice Souter will probably make a liberal decision
too.

But if we predict that Justice Ginsburg will make a conservative
decision, then we predict that Justice Souter will probably make a
conservative decision too.

[[../graphs/TheExperts.png]]

So this was really a dream team of experts. Additionally, the experts
were only asked to predict within their area of expertise. So not all
experts predicted all cases, but there was more than one expert making
predictions for each case.

For the 68 cases in October 2002, the predictions were made, and at
the end of the month the results were computed.

[[../graphs/CARTResults.png]]

For predicting the overall decision that was made by the Supreme
Court, the models had an accuracy of 75%, while the experts only had
an accuracy of 59%. So the models had a significant edge over the
experts in predicting the overall case outcomes.

However, when the predictions were run for individual justices, the
model and the experts performed very similarly.

For some justices, the model performed better, and for some justices,
the experts performed better.

[[../graphs/CARTAnalyticsEdge.png]]

We saw in this lecture that a model that predicts overall Supreme
Court decisions is both more accurate than experts and can be run much
faster than experts can make their predictions.

The CART models that we built were based on very high level components
of the cases, compared to the experts who can process much more
detailed and complex information.

This example really shows the edge that analytics can provide in
traditionally qualitative applications.

* Keeping an Eye on Healthcare Costs: The D2Hawkeye Story

** Video 1: The Story of D2Hawkeye

This is a story of D2Hawkeye, a medical data mining company located in
Waltham, Massachusetts.

[[../graphs/D2Hawkeye.png]]

It grew very fast and was sold to Verisk Analytics in 2009. The
overall process that D2Hawkeye uses is as follows.

It starts with medical claims that consist of diagnoses, procedures,
and drugs. These medical claims are then processed via process of
aggregation, cleaning, and normalization. This data then enters secure
databases on which predictive models are applied.

The output of predictive models are specific reports that give insight
to the various questions that D2Hawkeye aspires to answer.

[[../graphs/D2Hawkeye02.png]]

The company tries to improve health care case
management. Specifically, it tries to identify high-risk patients,
work with patients to manage treatment and associated costs, and
arrange specialist care.

[[../graphs/HealthcareCaseManagement.png]]

The overall goal of D2Hawkeye is to improve the quality of cost
predictions.

*D2Hawkeye had many different types of clients*.

[[../graphs/D2HEImpact.png]]


To analyze the data, the company used what we call a pre-analytics
approach. This was based on the human judgment of physicians who
manually analyze patient histories and developed medical rules.

Of course, this involved human judgment, utilized a limited set of
data, it was often costly, and somewhat inefficient. The key question
we analyze in this lecture is *Can we use analytics instead?*

[[../graphs/Pre-AnalyticsApproach.png]]

** Video 2: Claims Data

Let us discuss data sources in the health care industry. Hospitals in
southern Massachusetts versus California might use different
technologies and different platforms.

Finally there are strong privacy laws, HIPAA, around health care data
sharing.

[[../graphs/DataSources.png]]

Claims data is a major source. Claims data are requests for
reimbursement submitted to insurance companies or state-provided
insurance from doctors, hospitals and pharmacies.

Another source of data is the eligibility information for
employees. And finally demographic information: gender and age.

[[../graphs/DataSources02.png]]

Let me give you some examples on claims data. So this shows six
different claims. Let's consider this one.

So this is the provider's name. The corresponding diagnostic
code. This is about upper respiratory disorders. This is another code
associated with the diagnosis. This is the scientific term for the
diagnosis. The specific code again. This was an office visit, and it's
an established patient. The date.

And the amount of money that was claimed by the physician. Others
claims are similar.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ClaimsData.png]]

As we see, the claims data is a rich, structured data source. It is
very high dimensional. For example, claims involving diagnosis involve
thousands of different codes.

Similarly with drugs, where there are tens of thousands, and
procedures.

However, this collection of data does not capture all aspects of a
person's treatment or health. Many things must be inferred. Unlike
electronic medical records, we do not know the results of a test, only
that the test was administered.

For example, we do not know the results of a blood test, but we do
know that the blood test was administered.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ClaimsData02.png]]

The specific exercise we are going to see in this lecture is an
analytics approach to building models starting with 2.4 million people
over a three year span.

The observation period was 2001 to 2003. This is where this data is
coming from. And then out of sample, we make predictions for the
period of 2003 and 2004.

This was in the early years of D2Hawkeye. Out of the 2.4 million
people, we included only people with data for at least 10 months in
both periods, both in the observation period and the results period.

This decreased the data to 400,000 people.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ClaimsData03.png]]

** Quick Question (1 point possible)

A common problem in analytics is that you have some data available,
but it's not the ideal dataset. This is the case for this problem,

included in claims data? (Select all that apply.)

**** Answer

- [X] Blood test results

- [ ] Drugs prescribed to the patient

- [X] Physical exam results (weight, height, blood pressure, etc.)

*Explanation*

In claims data, we have drugs prescribed to the patient, but we don't
have blood test results or physical exam results.

** Video 3: The Variables

To build an analytics model, let us discuss the variables we
used. First, we used the 13,000 diagnoses. It's for the codes for
diagnosis that claims data utilize.

There were also 22,000 different codes for procedures and 45,000 codes
for prescription drugs. To work with this massive amount of variables,
we aggregated the variables as follows.

Out of the 13,000 diagnoses, we defined 217 diagnosis groups. Out of
the 20,000 procedures, we aggregated the data to develop 213 procedure
groups. And, finally, from 45,000 prescription drugs, we developed 189
therapeutic groups.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ClaimsData04.png]]

To illustrate an example of how we infer further information from the
data, the graph here shows on the horizontal axis, time, and on the
vertical axis, costs in thousands of dollars.

So patient one is a patient who, on a monthly basis, has costs on the
order of $10,000 to $15,000, a fairly significant cost but fairly
constant in time. Patient two has also an annual cost of a similar
size to patient one.

But in all but the third month, the costs are almost $0. Whereas in
the third month, it cost about $70,000. In fact, this is additional
data we defined indicating whether the patient has a chronic or an
acute condition.

[[../graphs/D2HE-Variables.png]]

In addition to the initial variables, the 217 procedure groups, and
189 drugs, and so forth, we also defined in collaboration with medical
doctors, 269 medically-defined rules.

For example, the first type of rule indicates the interaction between
various illnesses. For example, obesity and depression. Then new
variables regarding interaction between diagnosis and age. For
example, more than 65 years old and coronary artery disease.

Noncompliance with treatment. For example, non-fulfillment of a
particular drug order. And, finally, illness severity. For example,
severe depression as opposed to regular depression.

And the last set of variables involve demographic information like
gender and age.

[[../graphs/D2HE-Variables02.png]]

An important aspect of the variables are the variables related to
cost. So rather than using costs directly, we bucketed costs and
considered everyone in the group equally.

So we defined five buckets. So the buckets were partitioned in such a
way so that 20% of all costs is in bucket five, 20% is in bucket four,
and so forth. So the partitions were from 0 to 3,000, from 3,000 to
8,000, from 8,000 to 19,000, from 19,000 to 55,000, and above 55,000.

[[../graphs/D2HE-CostVariables00.png]]

The number of patients that were below 3,000 was-- 78% of the patients
had costs below 3,000. Just to remind you, we created a bucket so that
the total cost in each bucket was 20% of the total. But the number of
patients in bucket one, for example, is very high (78%).

[[../graphs/D2HE-CostVariables.png]]

Let us interpret the buckets medically. So this shows the various
levels of risk. Bucket one consists of patients that have rather low
risk. Bucket two has what is called emerging risk. In bucket three,
moderate level of risk. Bucket four, high risk. And bucket five, very
high risk.

So from a medical perspective, buckets two and three, the medical and
the moderate risk patients, are candidates for wellness
programs. Whereas bucket four, the high risk patients, are candidates
for disease management programs. And finally bucket five, the very
high risk patients, are candidates for case management.

[[../graphs/D2HE-MInterpretation.png]]

** Quick Question (1 point possible)

While we don't have all of the data we would ideally like to have in
this problem (like test results), we can define new variables using
the data we do have. Which of the following were new variables defined
to help predict healthcare cost? Select all that apply.

- [X] Variables to capture chronic conditions

- [X] Noncompliance to treatment

- [X] Illness severity

- [X] Interactions between illnesses

*** Answer

*Explanation*

All of these variables were defined using the claims data to improve
cost predictions. This shows how the intuition of experts can be used
to define new variables and improve the model.

** Video 4: Error Measures

Let us introduce the error measures we used in building the analytics
models.

Next measure, the so-called *penalty error*, is motivated by the fact
that if you classify a very high-risk patient as a low-risk patient,
this is more costly than the reverse, namely classifying a low-risk
patient as a very high-risk patient. Motivated by this, we developed a
penalty error.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ErrorMeasures.png]]

And the idea is to use asymmetric penalties. The graph here-- shows a
matrix-- where this is the outcome and this is the forecast.

For example, whenever we classify a low-risk patient as high-risk, we
pay a penalty of 2, which is a difference of 3 minus 1, the difference
in the error. But inversely, when you classify a bucket 3 patient as
bucket 1 patient, this is double.

The cost-- the penalty-- is double the amount. So you observe that the
off diagonal penalties are double the corresponding penalties in the
lower diagonal.

[[../graphs/D2HE-PenaltyError.png]]

To judge the quality of the analytics models we developed, we compare
it with a baseline. And the baseline is to simply predict that the
cost in the next "period" will be the cost in the current period.

We have observed that as far as identification of buckets is
concerned, the accuracy was $75\%$. So namely, whenever we predict that
the risk is bucket 3-- indeed it is bucket 3-- this happens $75\%$ of
the time, and the penalty error-- the average penalty error of the
baseline-- was $0.56$.

[[../graphs/D2HE-Baseline.png]]

** Quick Question (2 points possible)

The image below shows the penalty error matrix that we discussed in
the previous video.

[[../graphs/QQ4_PenaltyError.png]]

We can interpret this matrix as follows. Suppose the actual outcome
for an observation is 3, and we predict 2. We find 3 on the top of the
matrix, and go down to the second row (since we forecasted 2). The
penalty error for this mistake is 2. If for another observation we
predict (forecast) 4, but the actual outcome is 1, that is a penalty
error of 3.

*** Question a

What is the worst mistake we can make, according to the penalty error
matrix?

**** Answer

- [ ] We predict 5 (very high cost), but the actual outcome is 1 (very
  low cost).

- [X] We predict 1 (very low cost), but the actual outcome is 5 (very
  high cost).

*Explanation*

The highest cost is 8, which occurs when the forecast is 1 (very low
cost), but the actual cost is 5 (very high cost). It would be much
worse for us to ignore an actual high cost observation than to
accidentally predict high cost for someone who turns out to be low
cost.

*** Question b

What are the "best" types of mistakes we can make, according to the
penalty error matrix?

**** Answer

- [X] Mistakes where we predict one cost bucket HIGHER than the actual
  outcome.

- [ ] Mistakes where we predict one cost bucket LOWER than the actual
  outcome.

*Explanation*

We are happier with mistakes where we predict one cost bucket higher
than the actual outcome, since this just means we are being a little
overly cautious.

** Video 5: CART to Predict Cost

Let us introduce the method we used for predicting the bucket
number. It is called-- it is a method called classification and
regression trees.

In this case, we use multi-class classification. There are five
classes, buckets one to five. To give you an example, let us consider
patients that have two types of diagnosis:

- coronary artery disease and diabetes.

- So if a patient does not have a coronary artery disease, we'd
  classify the patient as bucket one.

- If it has coronary artery disease, then we check whether the person
  has diabetes or doesn't have diabetes.

    + If it has diabetes, then it's bucket five, very high risk.

    + And if it doesn't have diabetes, but given it has coronary
      artery disease, it is classified as bucket three.

[[../graphs/D2HE-MultiClass Classification.png]]

So this is an example in which we only have two diagnoses and we will
state how the method works.

In the application of Hawkeye, the most important factors were related
to cost in the beginning. So in the beginning, the classification tree
involved divisions based on cost.

For example,

- if the patient had paid less than $4,000-- so this is bucket one
  classification

- if it paid more than $4,000, then we further investigate whether the
  patient pays less than $40,000 or more than $40,000 and so forth.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ImportantFactors.png]]

As the tree grows, then the secondary factor is utilized later in the
classification tree involve various chronic illnesses and some of the
medical rules we discussed earlier.

For example,

- whether or not the patient has asthma and depression or not (Q146).

- If it has asthma and depression, then it's bucket five.

- If it doesn't, then we consider a particular indicator indicating
  hylan injection, which is an indication of a possible knee
  replacement or arthroscopy. So if this indicator is equal to 1, then
  it's bucket three.

- If it's indicator is equal to 0, it's not present, then it's bucket
  one.

So let us give some examples of bucket five.

[[../graphs/D2HE-SecondaryFactors.png]]

So let us give some examples of bucket five.

- So an example is as follows. The patient is under 35 years old, he
  has between 3,300 and 3,900 in claims, coronary artery disease as a
  diagnosis, but no office visits in the last year.

- Another example of a category of a patient that is classified as
  bucket five are claims between $3,900 and $43,000 with at least
  $8,000 paid in the last 12 months, $4,300 in pharmacy claims, and
  acute cost profile and cancer diagnosis.

- And another final example is more than $58,000 in claims, but at
  least $50,000 paid in the last 12 months, but not an acute profile.

Classification trees have the major advantage as being interpretable
by the physicians who observe them and judge them.

In other words, people were able to identify these cases as
reasonable. In other words, the human intuition agreed with the output
of the analytics model.

[[../graphs/D2HE-ExampleBuck5.png]]

** Quick Question (1 point possible)

What were the most important factors in the CART trees to predict
cost?

*** Answer

- [X] Cost ranges from the previous year

- [ ] Risk factors

- [ ] Chronic conditions

- [ ] Number of office visits last year

*Explanation*

The most important variables in a CART tree are at the top of the
tree - in this case, they are the cost ranges from the previous year.

** Video 6: Claims Data in R

In the next few videos, we'll be using the dataset
[[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/ClaimsData.csv.zip][ClaimsData.csv.zip]]. Please download the dataset to follow along. Note
that this file is in ZIP format due to its large size. You will need to
decompress (or unzip) the file before loading it into R.

This data comes from the [[http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF.html][DE-SynPUF dataset]], published by the United
States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

An R script file with all of the R commands used in this lecture can
be downloaded [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/Unit4_D2Hawkeye.R][here]].

We'll be using a data set published by the United States Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services to practice creating CART models to
predict health care cost. We unfortunately can't use the D2Hawkeye
data due to privacy issues.

The data set we'll be using instead, ClaimsData.csv, is structured to
represent a sample of patients in the Medicare program, which provides
health insurance to Americans aged 65 and older, as well as some
younger people with certain medical conditions.

To protect the privacy of patients represented in this publicly
available data set, a number of steps are performed to anonymize the
data. So we would need to retrain the models we develop in this
lecture on de-anonymized data if we wanted to apply our models in the
real world.

#+end_example

The observations represent a $1\%$ random sample of Medicare
beneficiaries, limited to those still alive at the end of 2008.

Our independent variables are from 2008, and we will be predicting
cost in 2009. Our independent variables are the patient's age in years
at the end of 2008, and then several binary variables indicating
whether or not the patient had diagnosis codes for a particular
disease or related disorder in 2008: alzheimers, arthritis, cancer,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or copd, depression, diabetes,
heart.failure, ischemic heart disease, or ihd, kidney disease,
osteoporosis, and stroke.

Each of these variables will take value $1$ if the patient had a
diagnosis code for the particular disease and value $0$ otherwise.

*Reimbursement2008* is the total amount of Medicare reimbursements for
this patient in 2008. And *reimbursement2009* is the total value of all
Medicare reimbursements for the patient in 2009. *bucket2008* is the
cost bucket the patient fell into in 2008, and *bucket2009* is the cost
bucket the patient fell into in 2009.

These cost buckets are defined using the thresholds determined by
D2Hawkeye.

So the first cost bucket contains patients with costs less than
$3,000, the second cost bucket contains patients with costs between
$3,000 and $8,000, and so on.

We can verify that the number of patients in each cost bucket has the
same structure as what we saw for D2Hawkeye by computing the
percentage of patients in each cost bucket.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Percentage of patients in each cost bucket:")
  table(Claims$bucket2009)/nrow(Claims)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Percentage of patients in each cost bucket:
:
:           1           2           3           4           5
: 0.671267781 0.190170413 0.089466272 0.043324855 0.005770679

The first cost bucket has almost 70% of the patients. The second cost
bucket has about 20% of the patients. And the remaining 10% are split
between the final three cost buckets.

*So the vast majority of patients in this data set have low cost*.

Our goal will be to predict the cost bucket the patient fell into in
2009 using a CART model.

But before we build our model, we need to split our data into a
training set and a testing set.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Split the data...")
  library(caTools)
  set.seed(88)

  spl <- sample.split(Claims$bucket2009, SplitRatio = 0.6)
  ClaimsTrain <- subset(Claims, spl==TRUE)
  ClaimsTest <- subset(Claims, spl==FALSE)

  writeLines("\n :: Dimensions of the training set:")
  dim(ClaimsTrain)

  writeLines("\n :: Dimensions of the testing set:")

** Quick Question (2 points possible)

*** Question

What is the average age of patients in the training set, *ClaimsTrain*?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The average age of the training set is:")
  mean(ClaimsTrain$age)
#+end_src

The average age of the training set is:
72.63773

*** Question

What proportion of people in the training set (ClaimsTrain) had at
least one diagnosis code for diabetes?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The proportion of patients that have equal or more than a diabetes code:")
  nrow(ClaimsTrain[ClaimsTrain$diabetes == 1, ]) / nrow(ClaimsTrain)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: The proportion of patients that have equal or more than a diabetes code:
: [1] 0.3808983

**** Answer

The proportion of patients that have equal or more than a diabetes code:
0.3808983

*Explanation*

Both of these answers can be found by looking at
summary(ClaimsTrain). The mean age should be listed under the age
variable, and since diabetes is a binary variable, the mean value of
diabetes gives the proportion of people with at least one diagnosis
code for diabetes.

Alternatively, you could use the mean, table, and nrow functions:

~mean(ClaimsTrain$age)~

~table(ClaimsTrain$diabetes)/nrow(ClaimsTrain)~

** Video 7: Baseline Method and Penalty Matrix

Let's now see how the baseline method used by D2Hawkeye would perform
on this data set. The baseline method would predict that the cost
bucket for a patient in 2009 will be the same as it was in 2008.

So let's create a classification matrix to compute the accuracy for
the baseline method on the test set.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Baseline method:")
  table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, ClaimsTest$bucket2008)

  writeLines("\n :: Baseline accuracy:")
  (110138 + 10721 + 2774 + 1539 + 104)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

 :: Baseline method:

         1      2      3      4      5
  1 110138   7787   3427   1452    174
  2  16000  10721   4629   2931    559
  3   7006   4629   2774   1621    360
  4   2688   1943   1415   1539    352
  5    293    191    160    309    104

 :: Baseline accuracy:
[1] 0.6838135
#+end_example

The accuracy is the sum of the diagonal, the observations that were
classified correctly, divided by the total number of observations in
our test set.

So the accuracy of the baseline method is $0.68$. Now how about the
penalty error?

To compute this, we need to first create a penalty matrix in R. Keep
in mind that we'll put the actual outcomes on the left, and the
predicted outcomes on the top.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Penalty Matrix:")
  PenaltyMatrix <- matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2,
                           6, 4, 2, 0, 1, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0), byrow = TRUE,
                         nrow = 5)
  PenaltyMatrix
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Penalty Matrix:
:      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
: [1,]    0    1    2    3    4
: [2,]    2    0    1    2    3
: [3,]    4    2    0    1    2
: [4,]    6    4    2    0    1
: [5,]    8    6    4    2    0

The actual outcomes are on the left, and the predicted outcomes are on
the top. So as we saw in the slides, the worst outcomes are when we
predict a low cost bucket, but the actual outcome is a high cost
bucket.

We still give ourselves a penalty when we predict a high cost bucket
and it's actually a low cost bucket, but it's not as bad.

So now to compute the penalty error of the baseline method, we can
multiply our classification matrix by the penalty matrix.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Penalty Error of Baseline Method:")
  as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, ClaimsTest$bucket2008))*PenaltyMatrix
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Penalty Error of Baseline Method:
:
:         1     2     3     4     5
:   1     0  7787  6854  4356   696
:   2 32000     0  4629  5862  1677
:   3 28024  9258     0  1621   720
:   4 16128  7772  2830     0   352
:   5  2344  1146   640   618     0

So what this does is it takes each number in the classification matrix
and multiplies it by the corresponding number in the penalty matrix.

So now to compute the *penalty error*, we just need to sum it up and
divide by the number of observations in our test set.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Overall accuracy of the baseline model:")
  sum(as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, ClaimsTest$bucket2008))*PenaltyMatrix)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Overall accuracy of the baseline model:
: [1] 0.7386055

Our goal will be to create a CART model that has an *accuracy higher*
than $68\%$ and a *penalty error* lower than $0.74$.

** Quick Question (2 points possible)

Suppose that instead of the baseline method discussed in the previous
video, we used the baseline method of predicting the most frequent
outcome for all observations. This new baseline method would predict
cost bucket 1 for everyone.

*** Question a

What would the accuracy of this baseline method be on the test set?

**** Answer

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The baseline accuracy is:")
  table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009)[1] / nrow(ClaimsTest)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: The baseline accuracy is:

*** Question b

What would the penalty error of this baseline method be on the test
set?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Penalty Matrix:")
  PenaltyMatrix2 <- c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
  PenaltyMatrix2

  writeLines("\n :: The penalty error for the Naive Baseline model:")
  sum(as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009)) * PenaltyMatrix2) / nrow(ClaimsTest)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Penalty Matrix:
: [1] 0 2 4 6 8
:
:  :: The penalty error for the Naive Baseline model:
: [1] 1.044301

*Explanation*

To compute the accuracy, you can create a table of the variable
ClaimsTest$bucket2009:

~table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009)~

According to the table output, this baseline method would get 122978
observations correct, and all other observations wrong. So the
accuracy of this baseline method is

~122978/nrow(ClaimsTest) = 0.67127~.

For the penalty error, since this baseline method predicts 1 for all
observations, it would have a penalty error of:

~(0*122978 + 2*34840 + 4*16390 + 6*7937 + 8*1057)/nrow(ClaimsTest) = 1.044301~

** Video 8: Predicting Healthcare Costs in R

We'll build a CART model to predict healthcare cost.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Load necessary libraries...")
  library(rpart)
  library(rpart.plot)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Load necessary libraries...

Now, let's build our CART model.

We'll call it *ClaimsTree*. And we'll use the *rpart* function to
predict *bucket2009*, using as independent variables: age, arthritis,
alzheimers, cancer, copd, depression, diabetes, heart.failure, ihd,
kidney, osteoporosis, and stroke. We'll also use bucket2008 and
reimbursement2008.

The data set we'll use to build our model is *ClaimsTrain*. And then
we'll add the arguments, method = "class", since we have a
classification problem here, and cp = 0.00005.

Note that even though we have a multi-class classification problem
here, we build our tree in the same way as a binary classification
problem.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: CART model:")
  ClaimsTree <- rpart(bucket2009 ~ age + alzheimers + arthritis + cancer +
                      copd + depression + diabetes + heart.failure +
                                ihd + kidney + osteoporosis + stroke +
                                bucket2008 + reimbursement2008,
                      data = ClaimsTrain, method = "class", cp = 0.00005)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: CART model:
: Warning message:

The cp value we're using here was selected through cross-validation on
the training set. We won't perform the cross-validation here, because
it takes a significant amount of time on a data set of this size.

Remember that we have almost 275,000 observations in our training
set.

But keep in mind that the R commands needed for cross-validation here
are the same as those used in the previous lecture on predicting
Supreme Court decisions.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="ClaimsCartModel" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

It might take a while to load, because we have a huge tree here. This
makes sense for a few reasons. One is the large number of observations
in our training set.

Another is that we have a five-class classification problem, so the
classification is more complex than a binary classification case, like
the one we saw in the previous lecture.

The trees used by D2Hawkeye were also very large CART trees. While
this hurts the interpretability of the model, it's still possible to
describe each of the buckets of the tree according to the splits.

We'll call our predictions PredictTest, where we'll use the predict
function for our model.

 :: The testing set penalty error:
[1] 0.7578902
#+end_example

So our penalty error is $0.758$. In the previous video, we saw that our
baseline method had an accuracy of $68\%$ and a penalty error of $0.74$. So
while we increased the accuracy, the penalty error also went up. Why?

By default, rpart will try to maximize the overall accuracy, and every
type of error is seen as having a penalty of one.

Our CART model predicts 3, 4, and 5 so rarely because there are very
few observations in these classes. So we don't really expect this
model to do better on the penalty error than the baseline method.

So how can we fix this? The rpart function allows us to specify a
parameter called *loss*. This is the penalty matrix we want to use
when building our model.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: New CART model with loss matrix:")
  ClaimsTree <- rpart(bucket2009 ~ age + alzheimers + arthritis + cancer +
                     copd + depression + diabetes + heart.failure +
                               ihd + kidney + osteoporosis + stroke +
                               bucket2008 + reimbursement2008,
                     data = ClaimsTrain, method = "class", cp = 0.00005,
                     parms = list(loss = PenaltyMatrix))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: New CART model with loss matrix:

So while our model is being built, let's think about what we expect to
happen. If the rpart function knows that we'll be giving a higher
penalty to some types of errors over others, it might choose different
splits when building the model to minimize the worst types of errors.

We'll probably get a lower overall accuracy with this new model. But
hopefully, the penalty error will be much lower too.

So now that our model is done, let's regenerate our test set
predictions.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  # Redo predictions and penalty error
  PredictTest <- predict(ClaimsTree, newdata = ClaimsTest, type = "class")

  table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest)

  writeLines("\n :: The penalty error is:")
  sum(as.matrix(table(ClaimsTest$bucket2009, PredictTest))*PenaltyMatrix)/nrow(ClaimsTest)
#+end_src

 :: The overall accuracy is:

 :: The penalty error is:
[1] 0.6418161
#+end_example

Our accuracy is now lower than the baseline method, but our penalty
error is also much lower. Note that we have significantly fewer
independent variables than D2Hawkeye had.

Note that we have significantly fewer independent variables than
D2Hawkeye had. If we had the hundreds of codes and risk factors
available to D2Hawkeye, we would hopefully do even better.

** Quick Question (1 point possible)

In the previous video, we constructed two CART models. The first CART
model, without the loss matrix, predicted bucket 1 for $78.6\%$ of the
observations in the test set. Did the second CART model, with the loss
matrix, predict bucket 1 for more or fewer of the observations, and
why?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The penalty matrix:")

- [ ] According to the penalty matrix, some of the worst types of
  errors are to not predict bucket 1 when the actual cost bucket is
  bucket 1. Therefore, the model with the penalty matrix predicted
  bucket 1 more frequently.

- [ ] According to the penalty matrix, some of the worst types of
  errors are to predict bucket 1 when the actual cost bucket is
  higher. Therefore, the model with the penalty matrix predicted
  bucket 1 more frequently.

- [ ] According to the penalty matrix, some of the worst types of
  errors are to not predict bucket 1 when the actual cost bucket is
  bucket 1. Therefore, the model with the penalty matrix predicted
  bucket 1 less frequently.

- [X] According to the penalty matrix, some of the worst types of
  errors are to predict bucket 1 when the actual cost bucket is
  higher. Therefore, the model with the penalty matrix predicted
  bucket 1 less frequently.

*Explanation*

If you look at the classification matrix for the second CART model, we
predicted bucket 1 less frequently. This is because, according to the
penalty matrix, some of the worst types of errors are to predict
bucket 1 when the actual cost bucket is higher.

** Video 9: Results

We will discuss the results of the classification tree model. So we
first observe that the overall accuracy of the method regarding the
percentage that it accurately predicts is $80\%$, compared to $75\%$
of the baseline.

But notice that this is done in an interesting way. For bucket one
patients, the two models are equivalent. But of course this suggests
the idea that healthy people stay healthy, which is the idea of the
baseline model.

The cost repeats is valid in the data.

[[../graphs/D2HE-Results.png]]

But then for buckets two to five, notice that the accuracy increases
substantially from 31% to 60%-- it doubles-- from 21% to 53%-- more
than doubles-- and from 19% to 39%-- doubles.

There's an improvement from 23% to 30%, not as big as before, but
there is indeed an improvement for bucket five. But notice the
improvement on the penalty from 0.56 to 0.52 overall.

A small improvement in bucket one, but a significant improvement as we
increase on the buckets. For example, here for bucket five, the
penalty error decreases from 1.88 to 1.01, a substantial improvement.

[[../graphs/D2HE-Results02.png]]

So we observed that there's a substantial improvement over the
baseline, especially as we go down on buckets. It doubles the accuracy
over the baseline in some cases. And so we have seen there's a smaller
accuracy improvement in bucket five, but there's a much lower penalty
in the prediction for bucket five.

[[../graphs/D2HE-Insights.png]]

So what is the edge of the analytics provided to D2Hawkeye?

First and foremost, there was a substantial improvement in the
company's ability to identify patients who need more
attention. Another advantage was related to the fact that the model
was in fact interpretable by physicians.

So the physicians were able to improve the model by identifying new
variables and refining existing variables. That really led to further
improvements. Finally, and quite importantly, the analytics gave the
company an edge over the competition using-- that the competition used
last century methods.

And the use of machine learning methods-- in this case, classification
trees-- provided an edge that also helped Hawkeye when it was sold to
Verisk Analytics in 2009.

* Video 1: Boston Housing Data (Recitation)

In real estate, there is a famous saying that the most important thing
is location, location, location. In this recitation, we will be
looking at regression trees, and applying them to data related to
house prices and locations.

Boston is the capital of the state of Massachusetts, USA.

[[../graphs/HD-Location.png]]

Some interesting data in the history of Boston.

[[../graphs/HD-Boston.png]]

Here is a shot of Boston from above. In the middle of the picture, we
have the Charles River. I'm talking to you from my office at MIT. My
office is here. This is MIT here. MIT lies in the city of Cambridge,
which is north of the river, and south of the river is Boston city,
itself.

In this recitation, we will be talking about Boston in a sense of the
greater Boston area.

However, if we look at the housing in Boston right now, we can see
that it is very dense. Over the greater Boston area, the nature of the
housing varies widely.

[[../graphs/HD-Boston02.png]]

This data comes from a paper, "Hedonic Housing Prices and the Demand
for Clean Air," which has been cited more than 1,000 times.

This paper was written on a relationship between house prices and
clean air in the late 1970s by David Harrison of Harvard and Daniel
Rubinfeld of the University of Michigan.

The data set is widely used to evaluate algorithms of a nature we
discuss in this class.

[[../graphs/HD-HousingData.png]]

We mostly discuss classification trees with the output as a factor or
a category. Trees can also be used for regression tasks. The output at
each leaf of a tree is no longer a category, but a number.

Just like classification trees, regression trees can capture
non-linearities that linear regression can't.

[[../graphs/RinCART.png]]

*So what does that mean?*

Well, with classification trees we report the average outcome at each
leaf of our tree. For example, if the outcome is true 15 times, and
false 5 times, the value at that leaf of a tree would be

$$
\frac{15}{(15 + 5)} = 0.75.
$$

Now, if we use the default threshold of 0.5, we would say the value at
this leaf is true. With regression trees, we now have continuous
variables.
