<p>
The recommendation systems in the Netflix business permit to the
executives take some decisions about the tendencies of the market. The
operating people is able to decide what kind of movies are potentially
more interesting to their customers.
</p>

<p>
Have a movie theater for each customer. In order to manage the big
volume of customers, Netflix needs an automated recommendation
system. This system allow the company to select and propose the best
titles for an specific customer.
</p>

<p>
The initial algorithm proposed could be improved, then the Netflix
price was open in order to develop a better algorithm.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Netflix was willing to pay over one million dollars for the best user
rating algorithm, which shows how critical the recommendation system
is to their business.
</p>

<p>
We will discuss how recommendation systems work. Let's start by
thinking about the data. When predicting user ratings, what data could
be useful? There are two main types of data that we could use. The
first is that for every movie in Netflix's database, we have a ranking
from all users who have ranked that movie. The second is that we know
facts about the movie itself&#x2013; the actors in the movie, the director,
the genre classifications of the movie, the year it was released,
etc.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-PredictingBestUserRatings.png" alt="NF-PredictingBestUserRatings.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As an example, suppose we have the following user ratings for four
users and four movies.
</p>

<p>
The ratings are on a one to five scale, where one is the lowest rating
and five is the highest rating. The blank entries mean that the user
has not rated the movie. We could suggest to Carl that he watch Men in
Black, since Amy rated it highly. She gave it a rating of five, and
<b>Amy and Carl seem to have similar ratings for the other movies</b>.
</p>

<p>
This technique of using other user's ratings to make predictions is
called collaborative filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-CollaborativeFiltering.png" alt="NF-CollaborativeFiltering.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that we're not using any information about the movie itself here,
just the similarity between users.
</p>

<p>
We saw in the table that Amy liked Men in Black. She gave it a rating
of five. We know that this movie was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is
classified in the genres of action, adventure, sci-fi, and comedy, and
it stars actor Will Smith. Based on this information, we could make
recommendations to Amy.
</p>

<p>
We could recommend to Amy another movie by the same director, Barry
Sonnenfeld's movie, Get Shorty. We can instead recommend the movie
Jurassic Park, which is also classified in the genres of action,
adventure, and sci-fi. Or we could recommend to Amy another movie
starring Will Smith&#x2013; Hitch.
</p>

<p>
Note that we're not using the ratings of other users at all here, just
information about the movie. This technique is called content
filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-ContentFiltering.png" alt="NF-ContentFiltering.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
There are strengths and weaknesses to both types of recommendation
systems.
</p>

<p>
Collaborative filtering can accurately suggest complex items without
understanding the nature of the items. It didn't matter at all that
our items were movies in the collaborative filtering example.
</p>

<p>
We were just comparing user ratings. However, this requires a lot of
data about the user to make accurate recommendations. Also, when there
are millions of items, it needs a lot of computing power to compute
the user similarities.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-StrengthsWeaknesses.png" alt="NF-StrengthsWeaknesses.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, content filtering requires very little data to get
started. But the major weakness of content filtering is that it can be
limited in scope.
</p>

<p>
You're only recommending similar things to what the user has already
liked. So the recommendations are often not surprising or particularly
insightful.
</p>

<p>
Netflix actually uses what's called a hybrid recommendation
system. They use both collaborative and content filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-HybridRecommendationSystems.png" alt="NF-HybridRecommendationSystems.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If we were only doing collaborative filtering, one of them would have
had to have seen it before. And if we were only doing content
filtering, we would only be recommending to one user at a time.
</p>

<p>
So by combining the two methods, the algorithm can be much more
efficient and accurate. In the next video, we'll see how we can do
content filtering by using a method called clustering.

Content Filtering.
</p>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
In the first case, the recommendation system would have to be
collaborative filtering, since it can't use information about the
items. In the second case, the recommendation system would be content
filtering since other users are not involved.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Video 3: Movie Data and Clustering</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
We will be using data from <b>MovieLens</b> to explain clustering and
perform content filtering.
</p>

<p>
<b>Movielens.org</b> is a movie recommendation website run by the GroupLens
research lab at the University of Minnesota. They collect user
preferences about movies and do collaborative filtering to make
recommendations to users, based on the similarities between users.
</p>

<p>
We'll use their movie database to do content filtering using a
technique called clustering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MovieLens-Data.png" alt="MovieLens-Data.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
First, let's discuss what data we have. Movies in the MovieLens data
set are categorized as belonging to different genres.
</p>

<p>
There are 18 different genres as well as an unknown category. The
genres include crime, musical, mystery, and children's. Each movie may
belong to many different genres. So a movie could be classified as
drama, adventure, and sci-fi.
</p>

<p>
The question we want to answer is, can we systematically find groups
of movies with similar sets of genres? To answer this question, we'll
use a method called clustering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MovieLens-ItemDataset.png" alt="MovieLens-ItemDataset.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
To answer this question, we'll use a method called
clustering. Clustering is different from the other analytics methods
we've covered so far. It's called an unsupervised learning
method. This means that we're just trying to segment the data into
similar groups, instead of trying to predict an outcome. In this image
on the slide, based on the locations of points, we've divided them
into three clusters&#x2013; a blue cluster, a red cluster, and a yellow
cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-WhyClustering.png" alt="ML-WhyClustering.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is the goal of clustering&#x2013; to put each data point into a group
with similar values in the data. A clustering algorithm does not
predict anything. However, clustering can be used to improve
predictive methods.
</p>

<p>
You can cluster the data into similar groups and then build a
predictive model for each group. This can often improve the accuracy
of predictive methods. But as a warning, be careful not to over-fit
your model to the training set. This works best for large data sets.
</p>

<p>
There are many different algorithms for clustering. They differ in
what makes a cluster and how the clusters are found.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-ClusteringMethods.png" alt="ML-ClusteringMethods.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You'll learn how to create clusters using either method in R. There
are other clustering methods also, but hierarchical and K-means are
two of the most popular methods. To cluster data points, we need to
compute how similar the points are. This is done by computing the
distance between points.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Quick Question (1 point possible)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
In the previous video, we discussed how clustering is used to split
the data into similar groups. Which of the following tasks do you
think are appropriate for clustering? Select all that apply.
</p>
</div>

</li>

<li><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Predicting the winner of the Major League Baseball World

</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
The first two options are appropriate tasks for clustering. Clustering
probably wouldn't help us predict the winner of the World Series.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Video 4: Computing Distances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
<b>So how does clustering work?</b> The first step in clustering is to
define the distance between two data points. The most popular way to
compute the distance is what's called Euclidean distance. This is the
standard way to compute distance that you might have seen before.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-Distance.png" alt="ML-Distance.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The distance between the two points, which we'll call dij, is equal to
the square root of the difference between the two points in the first
component, squared, plus the difference between the two points in the
second component, squared, all the way up to the difference between
the two points in the k-th component, squared, where k here is the
number of attributes or independent variables.
</p>

<p>
Let's see how this works by looking at an example. In our movie lens
dataset, we have binary vectors for each movie, classifying that movie
into genres. The movie Toy Story is categorized as an animation,
comedy, and children's movie.
</p>

<p>
So the data for Toy Story has a 1 in the spot for these three genres
and a 0 everywhere else.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-DistanceExample.png" alt="ML-DistanceExample.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The movie Batman Forever is categorized as an action, adventure,
comedy, and crime movie. So Batman Forever has a 1 in the spot for
these four genres and a 0 everywhere else.
</p>

<p>
So given these two data observations, let's compute the distance
between them.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-DistanceExample02.png" alt="ML-DistanceExample02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In addition to Euclidean distance, there are many other popular
distance metrics that could be used. One is called Manhattan distance,
where the distance is computed to be the sum of the absolute values
instead of the sum of squares.
</p>

<p>
Another is called maximum coordinate distance, where we only consider
the measurement for which the data points deviate the most.
</p>

<p>
Another important distance that we have to calculate for clustering is
the distance between clusters, when a cluster is a group of data
points.
</p>

<p>
We just discussed how to compute the distance between two individual
points, but how do we compute the distance between groups of points?
</p>

<p>
One way of doing this is by using what's called the <b>minimum
distance</b>. This defines the <b>distance between clusters</b> as the
distance between the two data points in the clusters that are closest
together.

<p>
For example, we would define the distance between the yellow and red
clusters by computing the Euclidean distance between these two
(marked) points.
</p>

<p>
The other points in the clusters could be really far away, but it
doesn't matter if we use minimum distance. The only thing we care
about is how close together the closest points are.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we could use maximum distance. This one computes the
distance between the two clusters as the distance between the two
points that are the farthest apart.
</p>

<p>
So for example, we would compute the distance between the yellow and
red clusters by looking at these two points. Here, it doesn't matter
how close together the other points are. All we care about is how
close together the furthest points are.

<p>
The most common distance metric between clusters is called centroid
distance. And this is what we'll use. It defines the distance between
clusters by computing the centroid of the clusters.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
The centroid is just the data point that takes the average of all data
points in each component. This takes all data points in each cluster
into account and can be thought of as the middle data point.
</p>

<p>
In our example, the centroids between yellow and red are here, and we
would compute the distance between the clusters by computing the
Euclidean distance between those two points.
</p>

<p>
When we are computing distances, it's highly influenced by the scale
of the variables.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-NormalizeData.png" alt="NF-NormalizeData.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As an example, suppose you're computing the distance between two data
points, where one variable is the revenue of a company in thousands of
dollars, and another is the age of the company in years. The revenue
variable would really dominate in the distance calculation.
</p>

<p>
The differences between the data points for revenue would be in the
thousands. Whereas the differences between the year variable would
probably be less than 10.
</p>

<p>
To handle this, it's <b>customary to normalize the data first</b>. We can
normalize by subtracting the mean of the data and dividing by the
standard deviation.
</p>

<p>
In our movie data set, all of our genre variables are on the same
scale. So we don't have to worry about normalizing. But if we wanted
to add a variable, like box office revenue, we would need to normalize
so that this variable didn't dominate all of the others.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've defined how we'll compute the distances, we'll talk
about a specific clustering algorithm: <b>hierarchical clustering</b>.
