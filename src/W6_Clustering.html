The recommendation systems in the Netflix business permit to the
executives take some decisions about the tendencies of the market. The
operating people is able to decide what kind of movies are potentially
more interesting to their customers.
</p>

<p>
Have a movie theater for each customer. In order to manage the big
volume of customers, Netflix needs an automated recommendation
system. This system allow the company to select and propose the best
titles for an specific customer.
</p>

<p>
The initial algorithm proposed could be improved, then the Netflix
price was open in order to develop a better algorithm.

</div>

<p>
Netflix was willing to pay over one million dollars for the best user
rating algorithm, which shows how critical the recommendation system
is to their business.
</p>

<p>
We will discuss how recommendation systems work. Let's start by
thinking about the data. When predicting user ratings, what data could
be useful? There are two main types of data that we could use. The
first is that for every movie in Netflix's database, we have a ranking
from all users who have ranked that movie. The second is that we know
facts about the movie itself&#x2013; the actors in the movie, the director,
the genre classifications of the movie, the year it was released,
etc.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-PredictingBestUserRatings.png" alt="NF-PredictingBestUserRatings.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As an example, suppose we have the following user ratings for four
users and four movies.
</p>

<p>
The ratings are on a one to five scale, where one is the lowest rating
and five is the highest rating. The blank entries mean that the user
has not rated the movie. We could suggest to Carl that he watch Men in
Black, since Amy rated it highly. She gave it a rating of five, and
<b>Amy and Carl seem to have similar ratings for the other movies</b>.
</p>

<p>
This technique of using other user's ratings to make predictions is
called collaborative filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-CollaborativeFiltering.png" alt="NF-CollaborativeFiltering.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that we're not using any information about the movie itself here,
just the similarity between users.
</p>

<p>
We saw in the table that Amy liked Men in Black. She gave it a rating
of five. We know that this movie was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is
classified in the genres of action, adventure, sci-fi, and comedy, and
it stars actor Will Smith. Based on this information, we could make
recommendations to Amy.
</p>

<p>
We could recommend to Amy another movie by the same director, Barry
Sonnenfeld's movie, Get Shorty. We can instead recommend the movie
Jurassic Park, which is also classified in the genres of action,
adventure, and sci-fi. Or we could recommend to Amy another movie
starring Will Smith&#x2013; Hitch.
</p>

<p>
Note that we're not using the ratings of other users at all here, just
information about the movie. This technique is called content
filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-ContentFiltering.png" alt="NF-ContentFiltering.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
There are strengths and weaknesses to both types of recommendation
systems.
</p>

<p>
Collaborative filtering can accurately suggest complex items without
understanding the nature of the items. It didn't matter at all that
our items were movies in the collaborative filtering example.
</p>

<p>
We were just comparing user ratings. However, this requires a lot of
data about the user to make accurate recommendations. Also, when there
are millions of items, it needs a lot of computing power to compute
the user similarities.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-StrengthsWeaknesses.png" alt="NF-StrengthsWeaknesses.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, content filtering requires very little data to get
started. But the major weakness of content filtering is that it can be
limited in scope.
</p>

<p>
You're only recommending similar things to what the user has already
liked. So the recommendations are often not surprising or particularly
insightful.
</p>

<p>
Netflix actually uses what's called a hybrid recommendation
system. They use both collaborative and content filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-HybridRecommendationSystems.png" alt="NF-HybridRecommendationSystems.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If we were only doing collaborative filtering, one of them would have
had to have seen it before. And if we were only doing content
filtering, we would only be recommending to one user at a time.
</p>

<p>
So by combining the two methods, the algorithm can be much more
efficient and accurate. In the next video, we'll see how we can do
content filtering by using a method called clustering.

Content Filtering.
</p>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
In the first case, the recommendation system would have to be
collaborative filtering, since it can't use information about the
items. In the second case, the recommendation system would be content
filtering since other users are not involved.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Video 3: Movie Data and Clustering</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
We will be using data from <b>MovieLens</b> to explain clustering and
perform content filtering.
</p>

<p>
<b>Movielens.org</b> is a movie recommendation website run by the GroupLens
research lab at the University of Minnesota. They collect user
preferences about movies and do collaborative filtering to make
recommendations to users, based on the similarities between users.
</p>

<p>
We'll use their movie database to do content filtering using a
technique called clustering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MovieLens-Data.png" alt="MovieLens-Data.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
First, let's discuss what data we have. Movies in the MovieLens data
set are categorized as belonging to different genres.
</p>

<p>
There are 18 different genres as well as an unknown category. The
genres include crime, musical, mystery, and children's. Each movie may
belong to many different genres. So a movie could be classified as
drama, adventure, and sci-fi.
</p>

<p>
The question we want to answer is, can we systematically find groups
of movies with similar sets of genres? To answer this question, we'll
use a method called clustering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MovieLens-ItemDataset.png" alt="MovieLens-ItemDataset.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
To answer this question, we'll use a method called
clustering. Clustering is different from the other analytics methods
we've covered so far. It's called an unsupervised learning
method. This means that we're just trying to segment the data into
similar groups, instead of trying to predict an outcome. In this image
on the slide, based on the locations of points, we've divided them
into three clusters&#x2013; a blue cluster, a red cluster, and a yellow
cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-WhyClustering.png" alt="ML-WhyClustering.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is the goal of clustering&#x2013; to put each data point into a group
with similar values in the data. A clustering algorithm does not
predict anything. However, clustering can be used to improve
predictive methods.
</p>

<p>
You can cluster the data into similar groups and then build a
predictive model for each group. This can often improve the accuracy
of predictive methods. But as a warning, be careful not to over-fit
your model to the training set. This works best for large data sets.
</p>

<p>
There are many different algorithms for clustering. They differ in
what makes a cluster and how the clusters are found.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-ClusteringMethods.png" alt="ML-ClusteringMethods.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You'll learn how to create clusters using either method in R. There
are other clustering methods also, but hierarchical and K-means are
two of the most popular methods. To cluster data points, we need to
compute how similar the points are. This is done by computing the
distance between points.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Quick Question (1 point possible)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
In the previous video, we discussed how clustering is used to split
the data into similar groups. Which of the following tasks do you
think are appropriate for clustering? Select all that apply.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4-1" class="outline-4">

</li>

<li><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Predicting the winner of the Major League Baseball World
Series.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
The first two options are appropriate tasks for clustering. Clustering
probably wouldn't help us predict the winner of the World Series.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Video 4: Computing Distances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
<b>So how does clustering work?</b> The first step in clustering is to
define the distance between two data points. The most popular way to
compute the distance is what's called Euclidean distance. This is the
standard way to compute distance that you might have seen before.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-Distance.png" alt="ML-Distance.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The distance between the two points, which we'll call dij, is equal to
the square root of the difference between the two points in the first
component, squared, plus the difference between the two points in the
second component, squared, all the way up to the difference between
the two points in the k-th component, squared, where k here is the
number of attributes or independent variables.
</p>

<p>
Let's see how this works by looking at an example. In our movie lens
dataset, we have binary vectors for each movie, classifying that movie
into genres. The movie Toy Story is categorized as an animation,
comedy, and children's movie.
</p>

<p>
So the data for Toy Story has a 1 in the spot for these three genres
and a 0 everywhere else.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-DistanceExample.png" alt="ML-DistanceExample.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The movie Batman Forever is categorized as an action, adventure,
comedy, and crime movie. So Batman Forever has a 1 in the spot for
these four genres and a 0 everywhere else.
</p>

<p>
So given these two data observations, let's compute the distance
between them.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/ML-DistanceExample02.png" alt="ML-DistanceExample02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In addition to Euclidean distance, there are many other popular
distance metrics that could be used. One is called Manhattan distance,
where the distance is computed to be the sum of the absolute values
instead of the sum of squares.
</p>

<p>
Another is called maximum coordinate distance, where we only consider
the measurement for which the data points deviate the most.
</p>

<p>
Another important distance that we have to calculate for clustering is
the distance between clusters, when a cluster is a group of data
points.
</p>

<p>
We just discussed how to compute the distance between two individual
points, but how do we compute the distance between groups of points?
</p>

<p>
One way of doing this is by using what's called the <b>minimum
distance</b>. This defines the <b>distance between clusters</b> as the
distance between the two data points in the clusters that are closest
together.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-DistanceBetweenClusters.png" alt="NF-DistanceBetweenClusters.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
For example, we would define the distance between the yellow and red
clusters by computing the Euclidean distance between these two
(marked) points.
</p>

<p>
The other points in the clusters could be really far away, but it
doesn't matter if we use minimum distance. The only thing we care
about is how close together the closest points are.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we could use maximum distance. This one computes the
distance between the two clusters as the distance between the two
points that are the farthest apart.
</p>

<p>
So for example, we would compute the distance between the yellow and
red clusters by looking at these two points. Here, it doesn't matter
how close together the other points are. All we care about is how
close together the furthest points are.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-DistanceBetweenClusters02.png" alt="NF-DistanceBetweenClusters02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The most common distance metric between clusters is called centroid
distance. And this is what we'll use. It defines the distance between
clusters by computing the centroid of the clusters.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-DistanceBetweenClusters03.png" alt="NF-DistanceBetweenClusters03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The centroid is just the data point that takes the average of all data
points in each component. This takes all data points in each cluster
into account and can be thought of as the middle data point.
</p>

<p>
In our example, the centroids between yellow and red are here, and we
would compute the distance between the clusters by computing the
Euclidean distance between those two points.
</p>

<p>
When we are computing distances, it's highly influenced by the scale
of the variables.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-NormalizeData.png" alt="NF-NormalizeData.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As an example, suppose you're computing the distance between two data
points, where one variable is the revenue of a company in thousands of
dollars, and another is the age of the company in years. The revenue
variable would really dominate in the distance calculation.
</p>

<p>
The differences between the data points for revenue would be in the
thousands. Whereas the differences between the year variable would
probably be less than 10.
</p>

<p>
To handle this, it's <b>customary to normalize the data first</b>. We can
normalize by subtracting the mean of the data and dividing by the
standard deviation.
</p>

<p>
In our movie data set, all of our genre variables are on the same
scale. So we don't have to worry about normalizing. But if we wanted
to add a variable, like box office revenue, we would need to normalize
so that this variable didn't dominate all of the others.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've defined how we'll compute the distances, we'll talk
about a specific clustering algorithm: <b>hierarchical clustering</b>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-6-1">
<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
The distance between these two movies is \(\sqrt{2}\). They have a
difference of 1 in two genres - crime and romance.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-7"><span class="section-number-3">2.7</span> Video 5: Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
In hierarchical clustering, the clusters are formed by each data point
starting in its own cluster. As a small example, suppose we have five
data points. Each data point is labeled as belonging in its own
cluster. So this data point is in the red cluster, this one's in the
blue cluster, this one's in the purple cluster, this one's in the
green cluster, and this one's in the yellow cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Then hierarchical clustering combines the two nearest clusters into
one cluster. We'll use Euclidean and Centroid distances to decide
which two clusters are the closest. In our example, the green and
yellow clusters are closest together.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical02.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical02.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So we would combine these two clusters into one cluster. So now the
green cluster has two points, and the yellow cluster is gone.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical03.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now this process repeats. We again find the two nearest clusters,
which this time are the green cluster and the purple cluster, and we
combine them into one cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical04.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical04.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now the green cluster has three points, and the purple cluster is
gone.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical05.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical05.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now the two nearest clusters are the red and blue clusters. So we
would combine these two clusters into one cluster, the red cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical06.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical06.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So now we have just two clusters, the red one and the green one.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical07.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical07.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So now the final step is to combine these two clusters into one
cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical08.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical08.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So at the end of hierarchical clustering, all of our data points are
in a single cluster.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Hierarchical09.png" alt="NF-Hierarchical09.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The hierarchical cluster process can be displayed through what's
called a <b>dendrogram</b>. The data points are listed along the bottom, and
the lines show how the clusters were combined. The height of the lines
represents how far apart the clusters were when they were combined.
</p>

<p>
So points 1 and 4 were pretty close together when they were
combined. But when we combined the two clusters at the end, they were
significantly farther apart. We can use a dendrogram to decide how
many clusters we want for our final clustering model.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-DisplayClusterProcess.png" alt="NF-DisplayClusterProcess.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This dendrogram shows the clustering process with ten data points. The
easiest way to pick the number of clusters you want is to draw a
horizontal line across the dendrogram.
</p>

<p>
The number of vertical lines that line crosses is the number of
clusters there will be. In this case, our line crosses two vertical
lines, meaning that we will have two clusters&#x2013; one cluster with
points 5, 2, and 7, and one cluster with the remaining points.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-SelectClusters.png" alt="NF-SelectClusters.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The farthest this horizontal line can move up and down in the
dendrogram without hitting one of the horizontal lines of the
dendrogram, the better that choice of the number of clusters is.
</p>

<p>
If we instead selected three clusters, this line can't move as far up
and down without hitting horizontal lines in the dendrogram. This
probably means that the <b>two cluster choice is better</b>.
</p>

<p>
But when picking the number of clusters, <b>you should also consider how
many clusters make sense</b> for the particular <b>application you're
working with</b>.
</p>

<p>
After selecting the number of clusters you want, you should analyze
your clusters to see <b>if they're meaningful</b>.
</p>

<p>
You can also check to see if the clusters have a feature in common
that was not used in the clustering, like an outcome variable. This
often indicates that your clusters might help improve a predictive
model.

<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
The Hierarchical clustering algorithm always starts with each data
point in its own cluster, and ends with all data points in the same
cluster. So there will be 212 clusters at the beginning of the
algorithm, and 1 cluster at the end of the algorithm.

<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
You can answer these questions by using the following commands:
</p>

<p>
<code>table(movies$Comedy)</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>table(movies$Western)</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>table(movies$Romance, movies$Drama)</code>

<h3 id="sec-2-11"><span class="section-number-3">2.11</span> Video 7: Hierarchical Clustering in R</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-11">
<p>
<b>Important Note</b>
</p>

<p>
In this video, we use the "ward" method to do hierarchical
clustering. This method was recently renamed in R to "ward.D". If you
are following along in R while watching the video, you will need to
use the following command when doing the hierarchical clustering
("ward" is replaced with "ward.D"):
</p>

<p>
<code>clusterMovies = hclust(distances, method = "ward.D")</code>
</p>

<p>
We'll use hierarchical clustering to cluster the movies in the Movie
Lens data set by genre. After we make our clusters, we'll see how they
can be used to make recommendations.
</p>

<p>
There are two steps to hierarchical clustering. First we have to
compute the distances between all data points, and then we need to
cluster the points.
</p>

<p>
To compute the distances we can use the <code>dist</code> function. We only want to
cluster our movies on the genre variable, not on the title variable,
so we'll cluster on columns two through 20.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #fffacd;">"\n :: Compute distances..."</span>)
distances <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> dist(movies[2:20], method = <span style="color: #fffacd;">"euclidean"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Compute distances...
</pre>

<p>
Now let's cluster our movies using the <code>hclust</code> function for
hierarchical clustering.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #fffacd;">"\n :: Hierarchical clustering..."</span>)
clusterMovies <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> hclust(distances, method = <span style="color: #fffacd;">"ward.D"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Hierarchical clustering...
</pre>

<p>
The second argument is ~method="ward"~. The ward method cares about
the distance between clusters using centroid distance, and also the
variance in each of the clusters.
</p>

<p>
Now let's plot the dendrogram of our clustering algorithm:
</p>


<div id="fig:MoviesDendrogram" class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/MoviesDendrogram.png" alt="MoviesDendrogram.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 37:</span> Movies dendrogram of clustering method</p>
</div>

<p>
This dendrogram might look a little strange. We have all this black
along the bottom. Remember that the dendrogram lists all of the data
points along the bottom. But when there are over 1,000 data points
it's impossible to read.
</p>

<p>
We'll see later how to assign our clusters to groups so that we can
analyze which data points are in which cluster.
</p>

<p>
So looking at this dendrogram, <b>how many clusters would you pick?</b> It
looks like maybe three or four clusters would be a good choice
according to the dendrogram, but let's keep our application in mind,
too.
</p>

<p>
We probably want more than two, three, or even four clusters of movies
to make recommendations to users.
</p>

<p>
It looks like there's a nice spot down here where there's 10
clusters. This is probably better for our application. We could select
even more clusters if we want to have very specific genre groups.
</p>

<p>
If you want a lot of clusters it's hard to pick the right number from
the dendrogram. You need to use your understanding of the problem to
pick the number of clusters. Let's stick with 10 clusters for now,
combining what we learned from the dendrogram with our understanding
of the problem.
</p>

<p>
We can label each of the data points according to what cluster it
belongs to using the cutree function.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">writeLines(<span style="color: #fffacd;">"\n :: Assign points to clusters..."</span>)
clusterGroups <span style="color: #db7093;">&lt;-</span> cutree(clusterMovies, k = 10)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
:: Assign points to clusters...
</pre>

<p>
Now let's figure out what the clusters are like. We'll use the tapply
function to compute the percentage of movies in each genre and
cluster.
</p>

<p>
So let's type tapply, and then give as the first argument,
movies$Action&#x2013; we'll start with the action genre&#x2013; and then
clusterGroups, and then mean.
</p>

<p>
<b>So what does this do?</b>
</p>

<p>
It divides our data points into the 10 clusters and then computes the
average value of the action variable for each cluster. Remember that
the action variable is a binary variable with value 0 or 1.
</p>

<p>
So by computing the average of this variable we're computing the
percentage of movies in that cluster that belong in that genre.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">tapply(movies$Action, clusterGroups, mean)
tapply(movies$Romance, clusterGroups, mean)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8
0.1784512 0.7839196 0.1238532 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.1015625 0.0000000 0.0000000
        9        10
0.0000000 0.0000000
         1          2          3          4          5          6          7
0.10437710 0.04522613 0.03669725 0.00000000 0.00000000 1.00000000 1.00000000
         8          9         10
0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000
</pre>

<p>
So we can see here that in cluster 2, about \(78\%\) of the movies have the
action genre label, whereas in cluster 4 none of the movies are
labeled as action movies.
</p>

<p>
Let's try this again, but this time let's look at the <b>romance</b>
genre. Here we can see that all of the movies in clusters six and
seven are labeled as romance movies, whereas only \(4\%\) of the movies
in cluster two are labeled as romance movies.

<p>
Knowing common movie genres, these clusters seem to make a lot of
sense.
</p>

<p>
<b>Let's see how these clusters could be used in a recommendation system.</b>
</p>

<p>
Remember that Amy liked the movie Men in Black. Let's figure out what
cluster Men in Black is in.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

 :: Find which cluster Men in Black is in:

</pre>

<p>
I knew that this is the title of Men in Black because I looked it up
in our data set. So it looks like Men in Black is the 257th row in our
data. So which cluster did the 257th movie go into?
</p>

<p>
It looks like Men in Black went into cluster 2. That make sense since
we just saw that <b>cluster 2 is the action, adventure, sci-fi cluster</b>.
</p>

<p>
So let's create a new data set with just the movies from cluster two.
</p>

<p>
So it looks like good movies to recommend to Amy, according to our
clustering algorithm, would be movies like Apollo 13 and Jurassic
Park.

In this video we saw how clustering can be applied to create a movie
recommendation system.

<h4 id="sec-2-11-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.11.1</span> An Advanced Approach to Finding Cluster Centroids</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-11-1">
<p>
In this video, we explain how you can find the cluster centroids by
using the function <b>tapply</b> for each variable in the dataset. While
this approach works and is familiar to us, it can be a little tedious
when there are a lot of variables.
</p>

<p>
An alternative approach is to use the colMeans function. With this
approach, you only have one command for each cluster instead of one
command for each variable. If you run the following command in your R
console, you can get all of the column (variable) means for cluster 1:
</p>

<p>
<code>colMeans(subset(movies[2:20], clusterGroups == 1))</code>
</p>

<p>
You can repeat this for each cluster by changing the <b>clusterGroups</b>
number. However, if you also have a lot of clusters, this approach is
not that much more efficient than just using the tapply function.
</p>

<p>
A more advanced approach uses the <code>split</code> and <code>lapply</code> functions. The
following command will split the data into subsets based on the
clusters:
</p>

<p>
<code>spl = split(movies[2:20], clusterGroups)</code>
</p>

<p>
Then you can use spl to access the different clusters, because
</p>

<p>
<code>spl[ [1] ]</code>
</p>

<p>
is the same as
</p>

<p>
<code>subset(movies[2:20], clusterGroups == 1)</code>
</p>

<p>
so <code>colMeans(spl[ [1] ])</code> will output the centroid of cluster 1. But
an even easier approach uses the lapply function. The following
command will output the cluster centroids for all clusters:
</p>

<p>
<code>lapply(spl, colMeans)</code>
</p>

<p>
The lapply function runs the second argument (colMeans) on each
element of the first argument (each cluster subset in spl). So instead
of using 19 tapply commands, or 10 colMeans commands, we can output
our centroids with just two commands: one to define spl, and then the
<code>lapply</code> command.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you have a variable called "split" in your current R
session, you will need to remove it with rm(split) so that you can use
the split function.

<p>
Run the <code>cutree</code> function again to create the cluster groups, but this
time pick <code>k = 2</code> clusters. It turns out that the algorithm groups all
of the movies that only belong to one specific genre in one cluster
(cluster 2), and puts all of the other movies in the other cluster
(cluster 1).
</p>

<p>
What is the genre that all of the movies in cluster 2 belong to?

Drama
</p>

<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
You can redo the cluster grouping with just two clusters by running
the following command:
</p>

<p>
<code>clusterGroups = cutree(clusterMovies, k = 2)</code>
</p>

<p>
Then, by using the tapply function just like we did in the video, you
can see the average value in each genre and cluster. It turns out that
all of the movies in the second cluster belong to the drama genre.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can use colMeans or lapply as explained below
Video 7.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-13">
<p>
Recommendation systems are used in many different areas other than
movies.
</p>

<p>
Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, said that, "If I have 3 million
customers on the web, I should have 3 million stores on the web."
</p>

<p>
The internet allows for mass personalization, and recommendation
systems are a key part of that. Recommendation systems build models
about users' preferences to personalize the user experience.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RecommendationSystems-MassPersonalization.png" alt="RecommendationSystems-MassPersonalization.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Recommendation systems are a cornerstone of these top
businesses. Social networking sites, like Facebook, music streaming
sites, like Pandora, and retail companies, like Amazon, all provide
recommendation systems for their users.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RS-Cornerstone.png" alt="RS-Cornerstone.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Both collaborative filtering and content filtering are used in
practice. Collaborative filtering is used by companies like Amazon,
Facebook, and Google News. Content filtering is used by companies like
Pandora, Rotten Tomatoes, and See This Next. And Netflix uses both
collaborative filtering and content filtering.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/RS-MethodUsed.png" alt="RS-MethodUsed.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So now let's go back to the Netflix prize.
</p>

<p>
To really test the algorithms, Netflix tested them on a private test
set that the teams had never seen before. This is the true test of
predictive ability.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-NetflixPrize.png" alt="NF-NetflixPrize.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
On September 18, 2009, Netflix announced that the winning team was
Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos. They won the competition and the $1 million
grand prize.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/NF-Winners.png" alt="NF-Winners.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Recommendation systems provide a significant edge to many
companies. In today's digital age, businesses often have hundreds of
thousands of items to offer their customers, whether they're movies,
songs , or people they might know on Facebook.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../graphs/TEA-RecommendationSystems.png" alt="TEA-RecommendationSystems.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Excellent recommendation systems can make or break these
businesses. Clustering algorithms, which are tailored to find similar
customers or similar items, form the backbone of many of these
recommendation systems.
</p>

<p>
Clustering also has many other interesting applications. In the next
lecture, we'll see how clustering can be used to improve the
predictive ability of classification methods.
