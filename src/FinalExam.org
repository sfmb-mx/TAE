* Final Exam

** Instructions

Please read and understand these instructions carefully before
starting the final exam.

Posts on the discussion forum about the final exam are not
allowed. The staff will be proactive in removing posts about the final
exam, and those caught posting about the final may have their account
disabled and their progress erased. If you have clarification
questions or you believe there might be a mistake in the exam, please
send an email to mit15071x@gmail.com, and we will respond to your
email as soon as possible. You should not send emails asking for
specific help on the problems though - this is only for clarification
questions or potential mistakes regarding the final exam.

We have designed the Explanations differently in the final exam than
the ones you are used to in the homework assignments. The
Explanations here will serve as hints to give you the name of the
functions you should have used, or a logical explanation of the
answer. They do not provide R code.

This final exam consists of four questions, with multiple parts to
each question. You are allowed to use any materials from this class
while working on the final exam, but please do not use outside
materials. You answers should represent your work and your work
alone.

* Part 1. Predicting Box OFfice revenue [0/16]

Each year, box offices at movie theaters collect billions of dollars
in revenue in the United States alone.  In this problem, we seek to
determine whether or not we can predict box office revenue based on
different variables related to a movie.

In this problem, we'll use a dataset of 334 movies that were produced
from 1953 to 2015. The dataset [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/Movies.csv][Movies.csv]] includes the following 24
variables:

- *Name* = the name of the movie

- *Year* = the year the movie was produced

- *Rated* = the rating given to the movie by the MPAA

- *Runtime* = the duration of the movie in minutes

- *Action* = binary variable that takes value 1 if the movie is an
  action movie, 0 otherwise

- *Adventure, Crime, Drama, Thriller, Fantasy, Horror, Sci.Fi, Comedy,
  Family, Mystery, Romance, Animation, Music, History, Documentary*
  are all defined like *Action*

- *Wins* = number of awards won by the movie

- *Nominations* = number of awards the movie was nominated for

- *Production.Budget* = the natural logarithm of the production budget
  in dollars

- *Worldwide* = the natural logarithm of the worldwide revenue in
  dollars

** TODO Problem 1 - Loading the Data (2 points possible)

Load the dataset Movies.csv into R and call it "Movies". In this
problem, we will build a model to predict worldwide box office revenue
for movies made in 2010-2015.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  library(parallel)

  if(!file.exists("../data")) {
          dir.create("../data")
  }

  fileUrl <- "https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/Movies.csv"
  fileName <- "MoviesP1Final.csv"
  dataPath <- "../data"

  filePath <- paste(dataPath, fileName, sep = "/")

  if(!file.exists(filePath)) {
          download.file(fileUrl, destfile = filePath, method = "curl")
  }

  writeLines("\n :: File downloaded...")

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: File downloaded...

Create a training set that consists of movies released before 2010 and
a testing set that consists of movies released in 2010 and after.

*** Question a

How many observations are in the training set ~MoviesTrain~?

*** Question b

How many observations are in the testing set ~MoviesTest~?

** TODO Problem 2 - Method of Splitting the Data (1 point possible)

In this class, we have frequently used the sample.split function to
randomly split our data. Why do we use a different approach here?
Check all that apply.

- [ ] We don't want to randomly split our data here, so the
  sample.split function is not appropriate.

- [ ] The sample.split function is typically used to split data with a
  categorical dependent variable, and we have a continuous dependent
  variable.

- [ ] The sample.split function is typically used to split data with a
  continuous dependent variable, and we have a categorical dependent
  variable.

- [ ] The sample.split function will give an error message if our
  dependent variable is not a factor variable.

- [ ] We have too many observations for the sample.split function to
  work.

** TODO Problem 3 - A Linear Regression Model (1 point possible)

Build a linear regression model to predict "Worldwide" based on all of
the remaining variables, except for Name and Year. Use the training
set to build the model. If your training set is called MoviesTrain, an
easy way to do this it to pass the argument

~data = MoviesTrain[ , 3:ncol(MoviesTrain)]~

to the lm function.

*** Question

What is the model's R-squared? (Please report the "Multiple R-squared"
value in the output.)

** TODO Problem 4 - Checking for Significance (1 point possible)

In your linear regression model, which of the independent variables
are significant at the p=0.05 level (at least one star)? For factor
variables, consider the variable significant if at least one level is
significant. Select all that apply.

- [ ] Rated

** TODO Problem 5 - Correlations (2 points possible)

*** Question a

What is the correlation between Worldwide and Production.Budget in the
training set?

*** Question b

Given this value, should Production.Budget be included in the model?

- [ ] Yes, it has high predictive value since the independent variable
  is correlated with a dependent variable.

- [ ] No, having highly correlated variables in a regression model can
  affect the quality of the resulting predictions.

** TODO Problem 6 - An Updated Model (1 point possible)

Create a new linear regression model on the training set with only the
significant variables you found in Problem 4 as the independent
variables. Going forward, we will only consider this linear regression
model.

*** Question

What is the model's R-squared? (Please report the "Multiple R-squared"
value in the output.)

** TODO Problem 7 - Understanding Coefficients (2 points possible)

*** Question a

In the model from Problem 6, what is the coefficient for Animation in
the linear regression?

*** Question b

The coefficient for Runtime is 0.010095. What is the interpretation of
this coefficient?

- [ ] For an additional unit of the variable Worldwide, the Runtime
  increases by approximately 0.01 minutes.

- [ ] For an additional minute of Runtime, the prediction for the
  variable Worldwide increases by approximately 0.01 units.

- [ ] For each additional minute of Runtime, the variable Worldwide
  will definitely increase by approximately 0.01 units; thus,
  directors should strive to make their movies as long as possible.

** TODO Problem 8 - Predictions on the Test Set (1 point possible)

*** Question a

Make predictions on the test set using your linear regression
model. What is the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) on the test set?

*** Question b

What is the Total Sum of Squares (SST) on the test set? Remember to
use the mean of Worldwide on the training set as the "baseline
model".

*** Question c

** TODO Problem 9 - Understanding the Model (1 point possible)

True or False: Our linear regression model suffers from overfitting.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

** TODO Problem 10 - A Classification Problem (2 points possible)

Let's turn this problem into a multi-class classification problem by
creating a new dependent variable. Our new dependent variable will
take three different values: "Excellent", "Average", and "Poor" for
films with Worldwide revenue in the top quartile, middle 50%, and
bottom quartile, respectively. Create this variable, called
"Performance", in your dataset Movies by running the following line in
your R console:

~Movies$Performance = factor(ifelse(Movies$Worldwide >~
~quantile(Movies$Worldwide, .75), "Excellent", ifelse(Movies$Worldwide~
~> quantile(Movies$Worldwide, .25), "Average", "Poor")))~

*** Question a

How many movies in the dataset Movies have Performance value Average?

*** Question b

How many movies in the dataset Movies have Performance value
Excellent?

*** Notes

Now, remove the original dependent variable "Worldwide" from your
dataset with the command:

~Movies$Worldwide = NULL~

Then, randomly split Movies into a training set, containing 70% of the
observations, and a testing set, containing 30% of the
observations. This time, you should use the sample.split function with
the dependent variable "Performance". Right before calling the
sample.split function, set the seed to 15071.

** TODO Problem 11 - A CART Model (1 point possible)

Build a CART model to predict "Performance" using all of the other
variables except for "Name and "Year" to build the model. (Unless you
have re-ordered your columns, an easy way to do this is to send
MoviesTrain[ , 3:ncol(MoviesTrain)] as the data argument, assuming
your new training set is called "MoviesTrain.") Remember that to
predict a multi-class dependent variable, you can use the rpart
function in the same way as for a binary classification problem. Just
use the default parameter settings (don't set a value for minbucket or
cp).

*** Question a

How many splits are in the resulting tree?

*** Question b

The CART model you just built predicts only two possible outcomes for
a movie with Production.Budget less than 18. Which outcome does it
never predict for these low-budget films?

- [ ] Excellent
- [ ] Average
- [ ] Poor

matrix. What is the overall accuracy of the model?

** TODO Problem 13 - A Baseline Model (1 point possible)

matrix. What is the overall accuracy of the model on the testing set?

** TODO Problem 15 - Baseline Accuracy on Testing Set (1 point possible)

What is the accuracy on the testing set of a baseline model that
predicts the most frequent outcome (Average) for all observations?

** TODO Problem 16 - Understanding the Model (1 point possible)

What can you conclude from the CART model?

- [ ] Turning this problem into a classification problem significantly
  improved the ability to predict movie revenue.

- [ ] Both the linear regression and CART models are well-suited for
  this prediction problem.

- [ ] The linear regression model is significantly better suited for
  the continuous prediction problem than the CART model is for the
  classification problem.

* Part 2. Forecasting Interest Rate Hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve [0/17]

The federal funds rate is the key interest rate that the U.S. Federal
Reserve uses to influence economic growth. The Federal Open Market
Committee meets regularly to decide whether to increase, decrease, or
maintain the target interest rate. Their choice has important
ramifications that cascade through the economy, so the announcement of
the interest rates is eagerly awaited each month.

In this problem, we will use analytics to try to predict when the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. We will look at monthly
economic and political data dating back to the mid-1960's. In this
analysis, the dependent variable will be the binary outcome variable
RaisedFedFunds, which takes value 1 if the federal funds rate was
increased that month and 0 if it was lowered or stayed the same. For
each month, the file [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/federalFundsRate.csv][federalFundsRate.csv]] contains the following
independent variables:


- *Date*: The date the change was announced.

- *Chairman*: The name of the Federal Reserve Chairman at the time the
  change was announced.

- *PreviousRate*: The federal funds rate in the prior month.

- *Streak*: The current streak of raising or not raising the rate,
  e.g. +8 indicates the rate has been increased 8 months in a row,
  whereas -3 indicates the rate has been lowered or stayed the same
  for 3 months in a row.

- *GDP*: The U.S. Gross Domestic Product, in Billions of Chained 2009
  US Dollars.

- *Unemployment*: The unemployment rate in the U.S.

- *CPI*: The Consumer Price Index, an indicator of inflation, in

- *HomeownershipRate*: The rate of homeownership in the U.S.

- *DebtAsPctGDP*: The U.S. national debt as a percentage of GDP

- *DemocraticPres*: Whether the sitting U.S. President is a Democrat
  (DemocraticPres=1) or a Republican (DemocraticPres=0)

- *MonthsUntilElection*: The number of remaining months until the next
  U.S. presidential election.

** TODO Problem 1: Loading the Data (1 point possible)

~library(caTools)~

~spl = sample.split(fedFunds$RaisedFedFunds, 0.7)~

Split months into a training data frame called "training" using the
observations for which spl is TRUE and a testing data frame called
"testing" using the observations for which spl is FALSE.

Why do we use the sample.split() function to split into a training and
testing set?

- [ ] It is the most convenient way to randomly split the data

- [ ] It balances the independent variables between the training and
  testing sets

- [ ] It balances the dependent variable between the training and
  testing sets

** TODO Problem 5 - Training a Logistic Regression Model (1 point possible)

Train a logistic regression model using independent variables
"PreviousRate", "Streak", "Unemployment", "HomeownershipRate",
"DemocraticPres", and "MonthsUntilElection", using the training set to
obtain the model.

Which of the following characteristics are statistically significantly
(p < 0.05, aka at least a * in the regression summary) associated with
an increased chance of the federal funds rate being raised?

- [ ] A higher federal funds rate in the previous month.

- [ ] A longer consecutive streak of months in which the federal funds
  rate was raised.

Problem 5, what is the predicted probability that the interest rate
will be raised?

** TODO Problem 8 - Interpreting Model Coefficients (1 point possible)

What is the meaning of the coefficient labeled "DemocraticPres1" in
the logistic regression summary output?

  (i.e. identical among the variables in the model).

- [ ] When the president is Democratic, the odds of the federal funds
  rate increasing are 34.8% higher than in an average month in the
  dataset.

- [ ] When the president is Democratic, the odds of the federal funds

* Part 3. Understanding Retail Consumers [0/15]

In Unit 6, we saw how clustering can be used for market segmentation,
the idea of dividing airline passengers into small, more similar
groups, and then designing a marketing strategy specifically for each
group.  In this problem, we'll see how this idea can be applied to
retail consumer data.

In this problem, we'll use the dataset [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/Households.csv][Households.csv]], which contains
data collected over two years for a group of 2,500 households.  Each
row (observation) in our dataset represents a unique household.  The
dataset contains the following variables:

- *NumVisits* = the number of times the household visited the retailer

- *AvgProdCount* = the average number of products purchased per
  transaction

- *AvgDiscount* = the average discount per transaction from coupon
  usage

- *AvgSalesValue* = the average sales value per transaction

- *MorningPct* = the percentage of visits in the morning (8am -
  1:59pm)

- *AfternoonPct* = the percentage of visits in the afternoon (2pm -
  7:59pm)

*Note* that some visits can occur outside of morning and afternoon
hours.  That is, visits from 8pm - 7:59am are possible.

This dataset was derived from source files provided by *dunnhumby*, a
customer science company based in the United Kingdom.

** TODO Problem 1 - Reading in the data (2 points possible)

Read the dataset Households.csv into R.

*** Question a

How many households have logged transactions at the retailer only in
the morning?

*** Question b

How many households have logged transactions at the retailer only in
the afternoon?

** TODO Problem 2 - Descriptive statistics (3 points possible)

*** Question a

In the dataset, what proportion of households visited the retailer at
least 300 times?

** TODO Problem 3 - Importance of Normalizing (1 point possible)

When clustering data, it is often important to normalize the variables
so that they are all on the same scale. If you clustered this dataset
without normalizing, which variable would you expect to dominate in
the distance calculations?

- [ ] NumVisits
- [ ] AvgProdCount
- [ ] AvgDiscount
- [ ] AvgSalesValue
- [ ] MorningPct
- [ ] AfternoonPct

** TODO Problem 4 - Normalizing the Data (2 points possible)

Normalize all of the variables in the Hubway dataset by entering the
following commands in your R console: (Note that these commands assume
that your dataset is called "Households", and create the normalized
dataset "HouseholdsNorm". You can change the names to anything you
want by editing the commands.)

~library(caret)~

~preproc = preProcess(Households)~

~HouseholdsNorm = predict(preproc, Households)~

(Remember that for each variable, the normalization process subtracts
the mean and divides by the standard deviation. We learned how to do
this in Unit 6.) In your normalized dataset, all of the variables
should have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

*** Question a

What is the maximum value of NumVisits in the normalized dataset?

*** Question b

What is the minimum value of AfternoonPct in the normalized dataset?

*** Note:

Run the following code to create a dendrogram of your data:

~set.seed(200)~
~distances <- dist(HouseholdsNorm, method = "euclidean")~
~ClusterShoppers <- hclust(distances, method = "ward.D")~
~plot(ClusterShoppers, labels = FALSE)~

** TODO Problem 10 - Random Behavior (4 points possible)

*** Question a

If we ran hierarchical clustering a second time without making any
additional calls to set.seed, we would expect:

- [ ] Different results from the first hierarchical clustering

- [ ] Identical results to the first hierarchical clustering

*** Question b

If we ran k-means clustering a second time without making any
additional calls to set.seed, we would expect:

*** Question d

If we ran k-means clustering a second time, running the command
set.seed(100) right before doing the clustering, we would expect:

- [ ] Different results from the first k-means clustering

- [ ] Identical results to the first k-means clustering

** TODO Problem 11 - The Number of Clusters (1 point possible)

to describe the consumer base. Would they want to increase or decrease
the number of clusters?

- [ ] Increase the number of clusters

which cluster best fits the description "frequent shoppers with low
value per visit"?

- [ ] Cluster 1
- [ ] Cluster 2
- [ ] Cluster 3
- [ ] Cluster 4
- [ ] Cluster 5

** TODO Problem 14 - Understanding Centroids (1 point possible)

Why do we typically use cluster centroids to describe the clusters?

- [ ] The cluster centroid captures the average behavior in the
  cluster, and can be used to summarize the general pattern in the
  cluster.

- [ ] The cluster centroid gives the values of every single
  observation in the cluster, and therefore exactly describes the
  cluster.

- [ ] The cluster centroid captures the average behavior in the
  cluster, relative to the other clusters. So by just computing a
  single cluster centroid, we can understand how the cluster differs
  from the other clusters.

** TODO Problem 15 - Using a Visualization (1 point possible)

distribution of NumVisits, broken down by cluster? Select all that
apply.

  on the ~y-axis~, plotting with ~geom_point()~

* Part 4. Optimal Course Scheduling [/]

You are about to enroll in a two-year Masters program in Analytics,
which you are expected to complete in four semesters.  During the four
semesters, you must take 7 courses from both optimization and
statistics (including required courses and electives). You also must
complete a one-semester thesis course.

The university registrar has provided the following schedule of
courses which will be offered over the next two years, along with the
average rating given to that course by previous students. Ratings for
an individual course may differ across semesters because they may be
taught by different professors. Not all courses are offered in every
semester; if a course is not offered, it is listed as "N/A" in the
table. The Thesis course does not have a rating.  "Th" simply denotes
that Thesis is offered during that particular semester.

| Thesis   | N/A       |         N/A | Th        | Th          |

The requirements for the program are as follows:

- You must complete Opt 101 and Stat 101 in your first year (i.e. by
  the end of Spring 2016).

- You must take Opt 201 and Stat 201.

- Each course (including Thesis) may only be taken once.

- You must take exactly two courses per semester. (Thesis is counted
  as a course.)

- You must take the Thesis course.

- You may not take Opt 201 and Stat 201 in the same semester, due to
  the difficulty of these courses.

You wish to get the most out of your degree program, so you decide to
draw up a schedule to maximize the sum of the projected ratings of the
courses that you end up taking.

** Problem 1 - The Decision Variables (2 points possible)

As mentioned above, you wish to determine which courses to take so
that you can graduate on time and have the best experience (determined
by the sum of the projected ratings of the courses you took). These
are the decisions for our optimization problem.

courses you take. How many decision variables defined in Problem 1
have to do with courses that have ratings? (These are the decision
variables that will participate in the objective!)

** Problem 4 - Scheduling Constraints (4 points possible)

*** Question a

You may only take each course offered at most once. How many
constraints in total do we need to add to the model to ensure this
requirement is met?

*** Question b

You must take exactly two courses per semester (Thesis is counted as a
course). How many constraints in total do we need to add to the model
to ensure this requirement is met?

** Problem 5 - Solving the Model (4 points possible)

Set up and solve this optimization problem in the spreadsheet software
of your choice (Excel, LibreOffice, or OpenOffice). Remember to define
all of your decision variables, your objective, and your constraints.

What is the optimal objective function value of the solution?

** Problem 6 - Understanding the Solution (2 points possible)

*** Question a

In the optimal solution, which electives do you take? Select all that
apply.

- [ ] Opt E1
- [ ] Opt E2
- [ ] Opt E3
- [ ] Stat E1
- [ ] Stat E2
- [ ] Stat E3

*** Question b

In which semester do you take the Thesis course?

- [ ] Fall 16
- [ ] Spring 17

** Problem 7 - Updating the Model (2 points possible)

For the following question, please reformulate your model and re-solve
it using a solver of your choice.

Upon arrival to campus, you are informed that the registrar has
revised the course requirements. You are now asked to take a total of
5 courses during the first two semesters, with at least two courses in
each semester. Remaining course requirements stay the same (including
the fact that you must take exactly two courses in each semester for
the last two semesters).

Formulate these new constraints and re-solve. What is the sum of all
of the ratings for the courses that you take now?

** Problem 8 - Updating the Model (1 point possible)

In the new optimal solution, which electives do you take? Select all
that apply.

- [ ] Opt E1
- [ ] Opt E2
- [ ] Opt E3
- [ ] Stat E1
- [ ] Stat E2
- [ ] Stat E3

** Problem 9 - Additional Constraints (2 points possible)

Please answer the following question without updating and re-solving
your model. (Do not change your model!)

Upon arrival to campus, you are informed by the registrar that you
must take Opt 201 before you can take the Thesis course. With this in
mind, in the new optimal solution, which of the following could happen
to the average projected rating of the courses that you take?

- [ ] Decrease, or stay the same as before.

- [ ] Increase.

** Problem 10 - Sensitivity Analysis (2 points possible)

For the following problem, do not re-run your model.

It is the end of your second semester, and you are very happy with the
course selections that you have made according to your model in
Problem 7. The registrar announces an update to their projected course
rating for Opt E2 for Fall '16 due to extremely positive feedback from
a new topic introduced by the professor in Fall '15. They have revised
the projected rating from 4.0 to 4.2.

Will this change affect your course selection for the remaining two
semesters?

- [ ] Yes

- [ ] No

- [ ] Cannot be determined without re-solving the optimization problem
