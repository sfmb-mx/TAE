* Final Exam

** Instructions

Please read and understand these instructions carefully before
starting the final exam.

Posts on the discussion forum about the final exam are not
allowed. The staff will be proactive in removing posts about the final
exam, and those caught posting about the final may have their account
disabled and their progress erased. If you have clarification
questions or you believe there might be a mistake in the exam, please
send an email to mit15071x@gmail.com, and we will respond to your
email as soon as possible. You should not send emails asking for
specific help on the problems though - this is only for clarification
questions or potential mistakes regarding the final exam.

We have designed the Explanations differently in the final exam than
the ones you are used to in the homework assignments. The
Explanations here will serve as hints to give you the name of the
functions you should have used, or a logical explanation of the
answer. They do not provide R code.

This final exam consists of four questions, with multiple parts to
each question. You are allowed to use any materials from this class
while working on the final exam, but please do not use outside
materials. You answers should represent your work and your work
alone.

* Part 1. Predicting Box Office revenue [11/17]

Each year, box offices at movie theaters collect billions of dollars
in revenue in the United States alone.  In this problem, we seek to
determine whether or not we can predict box office revenue based on
different variables related to a movie.

In this problem, we'll use a dataset of 334 movies that were produced
from 1953 to 2015. The dataset [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/Movies.csv][Movies.csv]] includes the following 24
variables:

- *Name* = the name of the movie

- *Year* = the year the movie was produced

- *Rated* = the rating given to the movie by the MPAA

- *Runtime* = the duration of the movie in minutes

- *Action* = binary variable that takes value 1 if the movie is an
  action movie, 0 otherwise

- *Adventure, Crime, Drama, Thriller, Fantasy, Horror, Sci.Fi, Comedy,
  Family, Mystery, Romance, Animation, Music, History, Documentary*
  are all defined like *Action*

- *Wins* = number of awards won by the movie

- *Nominations* = number of awards the movie was nominated for

- *Production.Budget* = the natural logarithm of the production budget
  in dollars

- *Worldwide* = the natural logarithm of the worldwide revenue in
  dollars

** DONE Problem 1 - Loading the Data (2 points possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-22 Sat 04:59]

Load the dataset Movies.csv into R and call it "Movies". In this
problem, we will build a model to predict worldwide box office revenue
for movies made in 2010-2015.

** DONE Problem 2 - Method of Splitting the Data (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-22 Sat 05:13]

In this class, we have frequently used the sample.split function to
randomly split our data. Why do we use a different approach here?
Check all that apply.

- [X] We don't want to randomly split our data here, so the
  sample.split function is not appropriate.

- [X] The sample.split function is typically used to split data with a
  categorical dependent variable, and we have a continuous dependent
  variable.

- [ ] The sample.split function is typically used to split data with a
  continuous dependent variable, and we have a categorical dependent
  variable.

- [ ] The sample.split function will give an error message if our
  dependent variable is not a factor variable.

- [ ] We have too many observations for the sample.split function to
  work.

CLOSED: [2015-08-22 Sat 06:08]

*** Question a

What is the correlation between Worldwide and Production.Budget in the
training set?

**** Answer

We can plot the data in order to know the big picture

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Calculating the entire correlation matrix...")
  MoviesTrainCor <- cor(MoviesTrain[, c(-1, -3)])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:

Now we can plot the correlation matrix

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="MoviesTrainCorrelationPlot" :session :results none silent :exports none
  library(corrplot)
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  corrplot(MoviesTrainCor)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots

#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  The MoviesTrain dataset correlation plot
#+NAME:     fig:MoviesTrainCorrelationPlot
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/MoviesTrainCorrelationPlot.png]]

We can see some kind of correlation between ~Worldwide~ and
~Production.Budget~.

Lets see how looks like in a scatter plot

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="WorldwideVsProductionBudgetPlot" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  library(ggplot2)

  ggplot(MoviesTrain, aes(x = Production.Budget, y = Worldwide)) + geom_point()
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  Worldwide vs. Production.Budget plot
#+NAME:     fig:WorldwideVsProductionBudgetPlot
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/WorldwideVsProductionBudgetPlot.png]]

We can calculate the correlation directly

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The correlation between Worldwide and Production.Budget:")
  cor(MoviesTrain$Worldwide, MoviesTrain$Production.Budget)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: null device
:           1
:
:  :: The correlation between Worldwide and Production.Budget:
: [1] 0.4947683

*** Question b

Given this value, should Production.Budget be included in the model?

- [X] Yes, it has high predictive value since the independent variable
  is correlated with a dependent variable.

- [ ] No, having highly correlated variables in a regression model can
  affect the quality of the resulting predictions.

: [1] 0.000000 0.010095 0.020190 0.030285 0.040380 0.050475

- [ ] For an additional unit of the variable Worldwide, the Runtime
  increases by approximately 0.01 minutes.

- [X] For an additional minute of Runtime, the prediction for the
  variable Worldwide increases by approximately 0.01 units.

- [ ] For each additional minute of Runtime, the variable Worldwide
  will definitely increase by approximately 0.01 units; thus,
  directors should strive to make their movies as long as possible.

** DONE Problem 9 - Understanding the Model (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-22 Sat 10:09]

True or False: Our linear regression model suffers from overfitting.

- [ ] True
- [X] False

The predicted R-squared doesn’t have to be negative to indicate an
overfit model. If you see the predicted R-squared start to fall as you
add predictors, even if they’re significant, you should begin to worry
about overfitting the model.

** DONE Problem 10 - A Classification Problem (2 points possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-22 Sat 11:01]

Let's turn this problem into a multi-class classification problem by
creating a new dependent variable. Our new dependent variable will
take three different values: "Excellent", "Average", and "Poor" for
films with Worldwide revenue in the top quartile, middle 50%, and
bottom quartile, respectively. Create this variable, called
"Performance", in your dataset Movies by running the following line in
your R console:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: New dependent variable for a mult-class classification problem...")
  Movies$Performance <- factor(ifelse(Movies$Worldwide > quantile(Movies$Worldwide,
                               0.75), "Excellent", ifelse(Movies$Worldwide >
                               quantile(Movies$Worldwide, 0.25), "Average", "Poor")))

* Part 2. Forecasting Interest Rate Hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve [0/17]

The federal funds rate is the key interest rate that the U.S. Federal
Reserve uses to influence economic growth. The Federal Open Market
Committee meets regularly to decide whether to increase, decrease, or
maintain the target interest rate. Their choice has important
ramifications that cascade through the economy, so the announcement of
the interest rates is eagerly awaited each month.

In this problem, we will use analytics to try to predict when the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. We will look at monthly
economic and political data dating back to the mid-1960's. In this
analysis, the dependent variable will be the binary outcome variable
RaisedFedFunds, which takes value 1 if the federal funds rate was
increased that month and 0 if it was lowered or stayed the same. For
each month, the file [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/federalFundsRate.csv][federalFundsRate.csv]] contains the following
independent variables:


- *Date*: The date the change was announced.

- *Chairman*: The name of the Federal Reserve Chairman at the time the
  change was announced.

- *PreviousRate*: The federal funds rate in the prior month.

- *Streak*: The current streak of raising or not raising the rate,
  e.g. +8 indicates the rate has been increased 8 months in a row,
  whereas -3 indicates the rate has been lowered or stayed the same
  for 3 months in a row.

- *GDP*: The U.S. Gross Domestic Product, in Billions of Chained 2009
  US Dollars.

- *Unemployment*: The unemployment rate in the U.S.

- *CPI*: The Consumer Price Index, an indicator of inflation, in

- *HomeownershipRate*: The rate of homeownership in the U.S.

- *DebtAsPctGDP*: The U.S. national debt as a percentage of GDP

- *DemocraticPres*: Whether the sitting U.S. President is a Democrat
  (DemocraticPres=1) or a Republican (DemocraticPres=0)

- *MonthsUntilElection*: The number of remaining months until the next
  U.S. presidential election.

** TODO Problem 1: Loading the Data (1 point possible)

observations for which spl is TRUE and a testing data frame called
"testing" using the observations for which spl is FALSE.

Why do we use the sample.split() function to split into a training and
testing set?

* Part 3. Understanding Retail Consumers [0/15]

In Unit 6, we saw how clustering can be used for market segmentation,
the idea of dividing airline passengers into small, more similar
groups, and then designing a marketing strategy specifically for each
group.  In this problem, we'll see how this idea can be applied to
retail consumer data.

In this problem, we'll use the dataset [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/Households.csv][Households.csv]], which contains
data collected over two years for a group of 2,500 households.  Each
row (observation) in our dataset represents a unique household.  The
dataset contains the following variables:

- *NumVisits* = the number of times the household visited the retailer

- *AvgProdCount* = the average number of products purchased per
  transaction

- *AvgDiscount* = the average discount per transaction from coupon
  usage

- *AvgSalesValue* = the average sales value per transaction

- *MorningPct* = the percentage of visits in the morning (8am -
  1:59pm)

- *AfternoonPct* = the percentage of visits in the afternoon (2pm -
  7:59pm)

*Note* that some visits can occur outside of morning and afternoon
hours.  That is, visits from 8pm - 7:59am are possible.

This dataset was derived from source files provided by *dunnhumby*, a
customer science company based in the United Kingdom.

** TODO Problem 1 - Reading in the data (2 points possible)

Read the dataset Households.csv into R.

so that they are all on the same scale. If you clustered this dataset
without normalizing, which variable would you expect to dominate in
the distance calculations?

- [ ] NumVisits
- [ ] AvgProdCount
- [ ] AvgDiscount
- [ ] AvgSalesValue
- [ ] MorningPct
- [ ] AfternoonPct

** TODO Problem 4 - Normalizing the Data (2 points possible)

Normalize all of the variables in the Hubway dataset by entering the

that your dataset is called "Households", and create the normalized
dataset "HouseholdsNorm". You can change the names to anything you
want by editing the commands.)

~library(caret)~

~preproc = preProcess(Households)~

~HouseholdsNorm = predict(preproc, Households)~

(Remember that for each variable, the normalization process subtracts
the mean and divides by the standard deviation. We learned how to do
this in Unit 6.) In your normalized dataset, all of the variables
should have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

*** Question a

What is the maximum value of NumVisits in the normalized dataset?

*** Question b

What is the minimum value of AfternoonPct in the normalized dataset?

*** Question d

If we ran k-means clustering a second time, running the command
set.seed(100) right before doing the clustering, we would expect:

- [ ] Different results from the first k-means clustering

- [ ] Identical results to the first k-means clustering

** TODO Problem 11 - The Number of Clusters (1 point possible)

Suppose the marketing department at the retail store decided that the
10 clusters were too specific, and they wanted more general clusters
to describe the consumer base. Would they want to increase or decrease
the number of clusters?

- [ ] Increase the number of clusters

- [ ] Decrease the number of clusters

- [ ] Keep it the same (10 clusters), just run it again

** TODO Problem 12 - Increasing the Number of Clusters (2 points possible)

Run the k-means clustering algorithm again, this time selecting 5
clusters. Right before the "kmeans" function, set the random seed
to 5000.

*** Question a

How many observations are in the smallest cluster?

*** Question b

How many observations are in the largest cluster?

** TODO Problem 13 - Describing the Clusters (1 point possible)

Using the cluster assignments from k-means clustering with 5 clusters,
which cluster best fits the description "frequent shoppers with low
value per visit"?

- [ ] Cluster 1
- [ ] Cluster 2
- [ ] Cluster 3
- [ ] Cluster 4
- [ ] Cluster 5

** TODO Problem 14 - Understanding Centroids (1 point possible)

Why do we typically use cluster centroids to describe the clusters?

- [ ] The cluster centroid captures the average behavior in the
  cluster, and can be used to summarize the general pattern in the
  cluster.

- [ ] The cluster centroid gives the values of every single
  observation in the cluster, and therefore exactly describes the
  cluster.

- [ ] The cluster centroid captures the average behavior in the
  cluster, relative to the other clusters. So by just computing a
  single cluster centroid, we can understand how the cluster differs
  from the other clusters.

** TODO Problem 15 - Using a Visualization (1 point possible)

Which of the following visualizations could be used to observe the
distribution of NumVisits, broken down by cluster? Select all that
apply.

- [ ] A box plot of the variable NumVisits, subdivided by cluster

- [ ] A box plot of the clusters, subdivided by NumVisits values

- [ ] ~ggplot~ with the cluster number on the ~x-axis~ and ~NumVisits~
  on the ~y-axis~, plotting with ~geom_histogram()~

- [ ] ~ggplot~ with ~NumVisits~ on the ~x-axis~ and the cluster number
  on the ~y-axis~, plotting with ~geom_point()~

* Part 4. Optimal Course Scheduling [0/10]

You are about to enroll in a two-year Masters program in Analytics,
which you are expected to complete in four semesters.  During the four
semesters, you must take 7 courses from both optimization and
statistics (including required courses and electives). You also must
complete a one-semester thesis course.

The university registrar has provided the following schedule of
courses which will be offered over the next two years, along with the
average rating given to that course by previous students. Ratings for
an individual course may differ across semesters because they may be
taught by different professors. Not all courses are offered in every
semester; if a course is not offered, it is listed as "N/A" in the
table. The Thesis course does not have a rating.  "Th" simply denotes
that Thesis is offered during that particular semester.


|          | Fall 2015 | Spring 2016 | Fall 2016 | Spring 2017 |
|----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+-------------|
| Opt 101  | 4.8       |         3.5 | N/A       | N/A         |
| Stat 101 | 2.2       |         4.2 | N/A       | N/A         |
| Opt 201  | N/A       |         4.1 | 3.7       | 3.9         |
| Stat 201 | N/A       |         4.6 | 3.9       | 2.3         |
| Opt E1   | N/A       |         4.9 | N/A       | 4.4         |
| Opt E2   | 3.4       |         N/A | 4.0       | N/A         |
| Opt E3   | N/A       |         4.9 | N/A       | N/A         |
| Stat E1  | N/A       |         2.0 | N/A       | N/A         |
| Stat E2  | 4.4       |         N/A | 4.7       | N/A         |
| Stat E3  | N/A       |         N/A | N/A       | 3.8         |
| Thesis   | N/A       |         N/A | Th        | Th          |

The requirements for the program are as follows:

- You must complete Opt 101 and Stat 101 in your first year (i.e. by
  the end of Spring 2016).

- You must take Opt 201 and Stat 201.

- Each course (including Thesis) may only be taken once.

- You must take exactly two courses per semester. (Thesis is counted
  as a course.)

- You must take the Thesis course.

- You may not take Opt 201 and Stat 201 in the same semester, due to
  the difficulty of these courses.

You wish to get the most out of your degree program, so you decide to
draw up a schedule to maximize the sum of the projected ratings of the
courses that you end up taking.

** TODO Problem 1 - The Decision Variables (2 points possible)

As mentioned above, you wish to determine which courses to take so
that you can graduate on time and have the best experience (determined
by the sum of the projected ratings of the courses you took). These
are the decisions for our optimization problem.

How many decision variables will there be in your optimization
formulation? (HINT: You do not need a variable if a course is not
offered.)

** TODO Problem 2 - The Decision Variables (1 point possible)

What type of decision variables should be used in the optimization
formulation?

- [ ] Continuous variables allowed to take negative or non-negative
  values

- [ ] Continuous variables limited to non-negative values

- [ ] Binary variables

- [ ] Integer variables allowed to take negative or non-negative
  values

- [ ] Integer variables limited to non-negative values

** TODO Problem 3 - The Objective (2 points possible)

Your objective is to maximize the sum of the projected ratings of the
courses you take. How many decision variables defined in Problem 1
have to do with courses that have ratings? (These are the decision
variables that will participate in the objective!)

** TODO Problem 4 - Scheduling Constraints (4 points possible)

*** Question a

You may only take each course offered at most once. How many
constraints in total do we need to add to the model to ensure this
requirement is met?

*** Question b

You must take exactly two courses per semester (Thesis is counted as a
course). How many constraints in total do we need to add to the model
to ensure this requirement is met?

** TODO Problem 5 - Solving the Model (4 points possible)

Set up and solve this optimization problem in the spreadsheet software
of your choice (Excel, LibreOffice, or OpenOffice). Remember to define
all of your decision variables, your objective, and your constraints.

What is the optimal objective function value of the solution?

** TODO Problem 6 - Understanding the Solution (2 points possible)

*** Question a

In the optimal solution, which electives do you take? Select all that
apply.

- [ ] Opt E1
- [ ] Opt E2
- [ ] Opt E3
- [ ] Stat E1
- [ ] Stat E2
- [ ] Stat E3

*** Question b

In which semester do you take the Thesis course?

- [ ] Fall 16
- [ ] Spring 17

** TODO Problem 7 - Updating the Model (2 points possible)

For the following question, please reformulate your model and re-solve
it using a solver of your choice.

Upon arrival to campus, you are informed that the registrar has
revised the course requirements. You are now asked to take a total of
5 courses during the first two semesters, with at least two courses in
each semester. Remaining course requirements stay the same (including
the fact that you must take exactly two courses in each semester for
the last two semesters).

Formulate these new constraints and re-solve. What is the sum of all
of the ratings for the courses that you take now?

** TODO Problem 8 - Updating the Model (1 point possible)

In the new optimal solution, which electives do you take? Select all
that apply.

- [ ] Opt E1
- [ ] Opt E2
- [ ] Opt E3
- [ ] Stat E1
- [ ] Stat E2
- [ ] Stat E3

** TODO Problem 9 - Additional Constraints (2 points possible)

Please answer the following question without updating and re-solving
your model. (Do not change your model!)

Upon arrival to campus, you are informed by the registrar that you
must take Opt 201 before you can take the Thesis course. With this in
mind, in the new optimal solution, which of the following could happen
to the average projected rating of the courses that you take?

- [ ] Decrease, or stay the same as before.

- [ ] Increase.

** TODO Problem 10 - Sensitivity Analysis (2 points possible)

For the following problem, do not re-run your model.

It is the end of your second semester, and you are very happy with the
course selections that you have made according to your model in
Problem 7. The registrar announces an update to their projected course
rating for Opt E2 for Fall '16 due to extremely positive feedback from
a new topic introduced by the professor in Fall '15. They have revised
the projected rating from 4.0 to 4.2.

Will this change affect your course selection for the remaining two
semesters?

- [ ] Yes

- [ ] No

- [ ] Cannot be determined without re-solving the optimization problem
