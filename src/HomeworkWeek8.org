* Investment management under taxation [11/11]

Billions of shares of stock, or fractions of ownership in a business,
are traded on the stock market every day. Over half of all adults in
the United States own stocks and 1.2 billion people worldwide invest
in the stock market. Many people invest in stocks to increase their
wealth and to increase their earnings beyond their salary. If the
business that you own stock in does well, then your stock value will
increase and you will make money.

An individual who owns stock can sell their shares, or a fraction of
their shares, to get cash that can be used for a down payment on a
home, to buy a new car, or for any other purchase. However, when you
sell stock, you have to pay both a transaction fee and  tax on the
money you gain. If you own many different stocks, you have to decide
what stocks and how much to sell to make sure you have enough cash for
your purchase. In this problem, we'll use linear optimization to
decide which shares of stock and how many you need to sell in order to
have enough cash to make your purchase, and to maintain a strong
portfolio of stocks.

** DONE Problem 1.1 - Formulating the Problem (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-15 Sat 19:50]

Suppose that, last year, you purchased *150 shares of eight different
stocks* (for a total of 1200 shares). The spreadsheet [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/Investment.ods][Investment.ods]]
for LibreOffice or OpenOffice, and [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/Investment.xlsx][Investment.xlsx]] for Microsoft
Excel, lists the stocks that you purchased, the price you purchased
them for last year, the current price, and the price estimate for next
year.

If you sell any shares, you have to pay a *transaction cost* of 1% of
the amount transacted.

In addition, you must pay a *capital-gains tax* at the rate of 30% on
any capital gains at the time of the sale. For example, suppose that
you sell 100 shares of a stock today at $50 per share, which you
originally purchased for $30 per share. You would receive
$5,000. However, you would have to pay capital-gains taxes of (USD):

$$
0.30 \times (5000− 3000) = 600
$$

and you would have to pay:

$$
0.01 \times 5000 = 50
$$

in transaction costs. Therefore, by selling 100 shares of this stock,
you would have a net cashflow of

$$
 5000 − 600 − 50 = 4350
$$

Note that none of the stocks decreased in value since the time of
purchase, so we don't have to deal with capital losses.

You would like to sell enough shares of stock today to generate
$10,000 to use as part of a down payment on a new home. You need to
decide how many shares of which stocks to sell in order to generate
*$10,000*, after taxes and transaction costs, while maximizing the
estimated value of your stock portfolio next year. Let's formulate
this as a linear optimization problem.

How many decision variables should your model have?

*** Answer

8 variables.

*Explanation*

We need one decision variable for each stock, representing the number
of shares to sell of that stock. Since we have 8 stocks, there are 8
decision variables.

** DONE Problem 1.2 - Formulating the Problem (2 points possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-15 Sat 19:50]

We'll assume for this problem that you can't sell more shares of stock
than you own, and you can't buy additional shares.

*** Question a

What is the maximum value your decision variables can be?

**** Answer

*150 shares*

*Explanation*

You can't sell more shares that you own, and since you own 150 shares
of each stock, the decision variables can't be any larger than 150.

*** Question b

What is the minimum value your decision variables can be?

**** Answer

*Zero shares*

*Explanation*

Since you can't buy additional shares (giving the decision variables
negative values) the minimum value the decision variables can be
is 0.

** DONE Problem 1.3 - Formulating the Problem (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-15 Sat 19:49]

Your objective is to maximize the estimated value of your stock
portfolio next year. To do this, you should sum the estimated value of
each stock next year. Suppose you sell x shares of your stock in
Microsoft.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The estimated value of your Microsoft stock next year:")
  x <- 10
  Vmn <- 34.55 * (150 - x)
  Vmn
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: The estimated value of your Microsoft stock next year:
: [1] 4837

*** Question

What is the estimated value of your Microsoft stock next year?

**** Answer

- [X] $34.55 * (150−x)
- [ ] $34.55 * x
- [ ] $2.05 * (150−x)
- [ ] $2.05 * x

*Explanation*

We expect Microsoft stock to be worth $34.55 next year. Since you will
have (150 - x) shares next year (after selling x shares), the
estimated value of your stock is $34.55 (150 - x)$.

** DONE Problem 1.4 - Formulating the Problem (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-17 Mon 22:14]

You need to make sure you get $10,000 in cash from selling your
stocks, after taxes and transaction costs.

*** Note

In LibreOffice (or in the spreadsheet software you are using),
formulate and solve this optimization problem. Make sure to include a
constraint for the amount of cash you generate, and upper and lower
bounds for the values of your decision variables.

*** Question

How much would you get in cash, after taxes and transaction costs, if
you sell 50 shares of your Intel stock?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  p <- 1 - 0.31
  p
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 0.69

**** Answer

1154.715

*Explanation*

The Intel stock is currently worth $23.67. If you sell 50 shares, then
you will receive $1183.50. You will have to pay taxes of thirty
percent times the current profit minus the amount you paid for it, or
0.30($1183.50 - $1127.00) = $16.95, and transaction costs of 1 percent
times the total amount, or 0.01($1183.50) = $11.84. So you will get in
cash, after taxes and transaction costs, $1183.50 - $16.95 - $11.84 =
$1154.71.

** DONE Problem 2.1 - Analyzing the Solution (2/2 points)
CLOSED: [2015-08-17 Mon 22:22]

In the optimal solution, which stocks do you sell at least one share
of? Select all that apply.

*** Answer

- [X] Yahoo!
- [ ] General Electric
- [X] Microsoft
- [ ] Bank of America
- [ ] JPMorgan Chase
- [ ] Cisco Systems, Inc
- [X] Intel
- [ ] Pfizer

*Explanation*

In the optimal solution, the decision variables with non-zero values
are those corresponding to Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Intel.

You can set up this optimization problem as follows. Suppose that you
add a column to the end of your table that indicates the number of
shares to sell (the decision variables). The decision variables will
therefore be in cells G6:G13.

Then the objective formula is:

~SUMPRODUCT(F6:F13;(C6:C13-G6:G13))~

And the cash constraint is given by the following formula:

~SUMPRODUCT(G6:G13;E6:E13) - 0.3*(SUMPRODUCT(G6:G13;E6:E13) -~
~SUMPRODUCT(G6:G13;D6:D13)) - 0.01*SUMPRODUCT(G6:G13;E6:E13) >= 10000~

Don't forget to also bound all of your decision variables to be less
than or equal to 150, and to be non-negative.

CLOSED: [2015-08-17 Mon 22:22]

What is the objective value of the optimal solution (the estimated
value of your portfolio of stocks next year)?

*** Answer

*26773.66 USD*

*Explanation*

The objective value after solving the problem is $26773.66.

** DONE Problem 2.3 - Analyzing the Solution (2 points possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-17 Mon 22:22]

How many shares of stock in total should you sell to make sure you
have enough cash, according to the optimal solution? (Assume that you
can sell fractional shares.)

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Shares sold:")
  67.723298056 + (2 * 150)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Shares sold:
: [1] 367.7233

*Explanation*

According to the optimal solution, you should sell 150 shares of
Microsoft, 150 shares of Intel, and 67.723 shares of Yahoo!. Since you
can only sell whole shares, you should sell 68 shares of Yahoo!, for a
total of 368 shares.

** DONE Problem 3.1 - Adjusting the Formulation (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-17 Mon 22:22]

As an invester, you like having a portfolio of eight different stocks
because it diversifies your investment. If one or two stocks do poorly
this year, you won't worry as much because you have many other
stocks. In the optimal solution for this problem, you sold all of your
shares of some stocks, but you would like to keep at least half of the
shares of each of your stocks.

Adjust the formulation so that you sell no more than 75 shares of each
stock, and solve it again.

In the optimal solution, you sell at least one share of which of your
stocks? Select all that apply.

*** Answer

- [X] Yahoo!
- [X] General Electric
- [X] Microsoft
- [ ] Bank of America
- [ ] JPMorgan Chase
- [X] Cisco Systems, Inc
- [X] Intel
- [X] Pfizer

*Explanation*

The decision variables with non-zero values in the optimal solution
are those corresponding to Yahoo!, General Electric, Microsoft, Cisco
Systems, Inc, Intel, and Pfizer. To reach this solution, just change
the upper bounds for the decision variables from 150 to 75 in the
Solver.

** DONE Problem 3.2 - Adjusting the Formulation (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-17 Mon 22:24]

What is the objective value of the optimal solution now?

*** Answer

26468.5411605165

*Explanation*

The objective value found in Solver is $26,468.54.

** DONE Problem 3.3 - Adjusting the Formulation (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:47]

Even though your investment is worth a bit less next year by
diversifying, you expect this diversification to help you long term.

However, you notice that you expect the Yahoo! stock to decrease in
value next year. So, while you would like to sell no more than 75
shares of your other stocks, you would like to sell exactly 100 shares
of your Yahoo! stock. Adjust your formulation in LibreOffice again,
and re-solve to get the new optimal solution.

*** Question

You now sell at least one share of how many different stocks?

**** Answer

5 different stocks.

*Explanation*

You sell at least one share of Yahoo!, General Electric, Microsoft,
Intel, and Pfizer, for a total of 5 different stocks.

You should remove the upper bound of 75 for Yahoo!, and add an
equality constraint stating that you should sell exactly 100 shares of
your Yahoo! stock.

** DONE Problem 3.4 - Adjusting the Formulation (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:48]

What is your estimated portfolio value next year?

*** Answer

26507.5253531624

*Explanation*

The new objective value, or estimated portfolio value next year, is
$26,507.53.

** Important note:

This problem showed how we can easily use linear optimization to solve
a simple portfolio optimization problem. However, there are many ways
that we can extend this problem to make it more realistic. We could
use regression to predict the future stock prices, and incorporate
regression models into the optimization problem. You'll see how to do
this next week.

Portfolio optimization is a very advanced and sophisticated field of
optimization.  In reality, it is often a multi-stage nonlinear
optimization problem. For more information, see

* Filatoi Riuniti [11/11]

The northern regions of Italy are the heartlands of the Italian
textile industry, providing textile products for many great Italian
(and non-Italian) fashion houses. Most of today's companies were
founded at the turn of the century and have grown and thrived despite
a series of twentieth century catastrophes, including the Great
Depression and World War II. Sales in the entire Italian textile and
apparel industry were about $80 billion in 2007. The Italian
textile-fashion industry employs over 400,000 people.

Filatoi Riuniti is a family-owned spinning mill located in northwest
Italy. They produce cotton yarn, which is one of the raw materials
that is used to produce the fabrics that are then cut and sewn by
Italian stylists into the worldwide famous Italian clothes.

Demand for Filatoi Riuniti's production is strong, but their spinning
machine capacity is insufficient to meet its production orders. They
decided to outsource part of the spinning production to six local
family-owned spinning mills: Ambrosi, Bresciani, Castri, De Blasi,
Estensi, and Giuliani. The local mills charge higher prices for
spinning finer yarns, so Filatoi Riuniti has decided to spin as much
as possible of the finer yarns entirely in-house and to outsource only
the spinning of low-end (coarser) yarns. Last month, they faced a
total demand of 104,500 kg of cotton and they outsourced 32,000 kg of
the low-end sizes.

Filatoi Riuniti hired a consulting firm to see if the outsourcing
strategies to the six local mills could be improved. After analyzing
the data, they immediately saw the potential for very large savings
through more optimal outsourcing strategies. In this problem, we'll
improve the outsourcing strategy of Filatoi Riuniti using linear
optimization. (Note: This problem is based off of a real case, but the
names have been changed for privacy reasons.)

** DONE Problem 1.1 - Formulating the Optimization Problem (3/3 points)
CLOSED: [2015-08-18 Tue 00:13]

Filatoi Riuniti produces four different sizes of yarn: extra fine,
fine, medium, and coarse. Their current strategy is to produce all of
the fine and extra fine yarn in-house, outsource some of the medium
yarn to the lowest-price mill, and outsource all of the coarse yarn to
the other mills. To try to improve this strategy, let's set up an
optimization problem.

The spreadsheet FilatoiRiuniti.ods for LibreOffice or OpenOffice, and
FilatoiRiuniti.xlsx for Microsoft Excel, contains data for the
problem. This data includes information about production hours,
capacities, costs, and demand. Ambrosi and De Blasi can't produce
extra fine yarn, so no data is provided for extra fine yarn at these
mills.

The decision variables are the amount of yarn of each size that each
company should be assigned to produce. There are four sizes, and seven
companies (including Filatoi Riuniti). These decision variables are
set up in the spreadsheet. Note that the decision variables should be
non-negative - none of the mills can produce a negative amount of
yarn!

The objective is to minimize costs. The prices charged by the six
local mills for production, as well as the production cost at Filatoi
Riuniti, are provided in the spreadsheet. Additionally, the yarn that
is spun by the six local mills needs to be transported. The
transportation costs per kg of yarn are also provided in the
spreadsheet.

Our model has two types of constraints: capacity constraints and
demand constraints. The spreadsheet contains a table showing the
production capacity and production rate per product for each of the
mills (including Filatoi Riuniti). For example, at the Bresciani mill,
it takes 0.70 hours to produce one kg of extra fine yarn, and there
are a total of 3,000 machines hours per month available at this
mill. There is also a table that estimates the demand for the four
yarn sizes in the current month. We should produce at least the demand
for each yarn type.

Formulate and solve this problem in LibreOffice (or in the spreadsheet
software you are using). The objective should minimize the sum of the
production and transportation costs. You should have the following
constraints: non-negative decision variables, a capacity constraint
for each mill, and a demand constraint for each type of yarn. Remember
that Ambrosi and De Blasi can't produce extra fine yarn, so you should
also account for this.

*** Question

What is the objective value of the solution?

**** Answer

1382544.33431492

*Explanation*

After setting up and solving the problem, the objective value of the
solution is $1,382,544.33.

The formula for the objective is:

~SUMPRODUCT(B53:E59;B25:E31) + SUMPRODUCT(B53:E59;B35:E41)~

You should select that you want to minimize the objective in Solver.

The formulas for the constraints are as follows:

~Ambrosi No Extra Fine Yarn: B53 = 0~

~De Blasi No Extra Fine Yarn: B56 = 0~

~Ambrosi Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B53:E53;B5:E5) <= B15~

~Bresciani Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B54:E54;B6:E6) <= B16~

~Castri Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B55:E55;B7:E7) <= B17~

~De Blasi Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B56:E56;B8:E8) <= B18~

~Estensi Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B57:E57;B9:E9) <= B19~

~Filatoi Riuniti Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B58:E58;B10:E10) <= B20~

~Giuliani Capacity: SUMPRODUCT(B59:E59;B11:E11) <= B21~

~Extra Fine Demand: SUM(B53:B59) >= B45~

~Fine Demand: SUM(C53:C59) >= B46~

~Medium Demand: SUM(D53:D59) >= B47~

~Coarse Demand: SUM(E53:E59) >= B48~

How many kg of medium yarn is outsourced?

*** Answer

9182.9825947473 - correct

*Explanation*

We need to sum the values of the decision variables for medium yarn at
the other mills. We outsource 2040.125 kg of medium yarn to De Blasi,
and 7142.857 kg of medium yarn to Giuliani, for a total of 9182.982
kg.

CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:51]

How many kg of fine yarn is outsourced?

*** Answer

6250.000 - correct

*Explanation*

We outsource 6250 kg of fine yarn to Ambrosi, and produce the rest
in-house. So a total of 6250 kg of fine yarn is outsourced.

** DONE Problem 1.4 - Formulating the Optimization Problem (1/1 point)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:54]

At which mills does Filatoi use the maximum capacity available? Select
all that apply.

- [X] Ambrosi
- [X] Bresciani
- [X] Castri
- [ ] De Blasi
- [X] Estensi
- [X] Filatoi Riuniti
- [X] Giuliani

Ambrosi, Bresciani, Castri, Estensi, Filatoi Riuniti, Giuliani, - correct

*Explanation*

To answer this question, we need to look at the capacity constraints,
and see which ones are satisfied at equality. We use the maximum
capacity available at all mills except for De Blasi, where we only use
714 of the 2600 hours available.

** DONE Problem 2.1 - Sensitivity Analysis (1/1 point)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:54]

In Problems 2 and 3, we'll be checking how sensitive our model is to
the data and constraints. If you change the constraints or data values
to answer any of the questions, make sure to change them back to the
original values before continuing on to the next problem.

Filatoi Riuniti should obviously consider increasing its spinning
machine capacity. They could slightly expand the production capacity
of the existing machines by renting an upgrade. This would increase
their spinning production capacity by 600 hours/month. The monthly
rental cost is $1,500/month. Would you recommend that they rent the
upgrade?

*** Answer

- [ ] Yes, they should rent the upgrade

- [X] No, they should not rent the upgrade - correct

*Explanation*

Increasing Filatoi Riuniti's spinning capacity by 600 hours/month and
resolving the problem decreases the objective value to $1,381,273.75,
which means that they save $1270.59 in costs. But since the cost of
the upgrade is $1,500, it is not worth it to rent the upgrade.

** DONE Problem 2.2 - Sensitivity Analysis (1/1 point)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:58]

Alternatively, Filatoi Riuniti could increase its spinning machine
capacity by renting another spinning machine for the production of
only medium size yarn, for a monthly rental cost of $3,000. The
machine has a production capacity of 300 hours per month (the machine
would run at the same rate of 0.425 hours/Kg). Suppose that the
estimated production cost of running this machine is less than that
for Filatoi Riuniti's existing machines and is estimated to be
$5.70/Kg (as opposed to $11.40/Kg for their existing machines). Would
you recommend that Filatoi Riuniti rent the machine?

- [X] Yes, they should rent the machine. - correct

- [ ] No, they should not rent the machine.

*Explanation*

For this problem, the extra capacity is only for medium sized yarn. We
can look at our optimal solution and see how medium yarn is currently
being produced. We are producing 18,817.017 kg in-house, 2,040.125 kg
at De Blasi, and 7,142.857 kg at Giuliani. If we look at the total
costs, we can see that the most expensive place that we are currently
producing at is De Blasi, at a cost of $12.30 per kg (production plus
transportation costs). An extra 300 hours of medium production
capacity at Filatoi allows us to produce 300/0.425 = 706 kg of
additional medium sized yarn, so we would take these kg away from De
Blasi and produce them in-house. The benefit of doing so is
706($12.30 - $5.70) = $4660. Since this is larger than the rental cost
of $3,000, we should rent the machine.

Alternatively, you could adjust the production capacity and analyze
how the model changes. If you add 300 production hours for Filatoi,
the objective decreases by $635.29. However, since we’re producing
more than 705.88 kg of medium yarn in-house, we know that we’re
getting the 705.88 from that machine at $5.70/kg cheaper than the
objective thinks we are, meaning the real cost is actually
$5.70*705.88=$4023.53 lower, and we have a total savings of
$4023.53+$635.29=$4658.82, more than the cost of $3000.

** DONE Problem 2.3 - Sensitivity Analysis (1/1 point)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:58]

Suppose that the shadow price of the medium yarn demand constraint is
$12.30, with an allowable increase of 5388. Recall that the shadow
price is the amount that the objective increases per unit increase in
the right hand side of the constraint. So a shadow price of $12.30 for
the medium yarn demand constraint means that the cost increases by
$12.30 for every unit increase in the medium yarn demand. The
allowable increase of 5388 means that this shadow price hold up to an
increase of 5388 in the right hand side of this constraint. If we
increase the right hand side by more than 5388, the shadow price will
change, and it is impossible to know how it changes without re-solving
the model.

A new client is interested in purchasing up to 5,000 kg/month of
medium size yarn. What is the minimum price per kg of yarn that
Filatoi Riuniti should quote to this new client? (In answering this
question, assume that Filatoi has not decided to increase its spinning
machine capacity, and that Filatoi does not want to change the prices
that they currently charge their existing clients.)

*** Answer

12.30 - correct

*Explanation*

Filatoi should charge at least $12.30 per kg to the new client, since
this is the amount it will cost per-unit to increase the medium yarn
demand by 5,000.

Now suppose that the client wants to purchase 6,000 kg/month of medium
size yarn. Now what is the minimum price per kg of yarn that Filatoi
Riuniti should quote to this new client? (In answering this question,
assume that Filatoi has not decided to increase its spinning machine
capacity, and that Filatoi does not want to change the prices that
they currently charge their existing clients.)

*** Answer

12.4489247298 - correct

*Explanation*

We can't answer this question using just the shadow price, since it
only holds for an allowable increase of 5,388. But we can increase the
demand for medium yarn by 6,000 (to 34,000) and re-solve our
optimization problem. The new objective value is
1,457,237.88. Comparing this to the old objective of 1,382,544.33, the
increase is 74,693.55. Dividing by 6,000, this is an increase of 12.45
per kg. This is the minimum price that we should charge the client per
kg of yarn.

CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:58]

In many situations, the problem data is estimated but is not known for
sure. In this problem, the optimization model is based in part on the
prices charged by the local mills to Filatoi Riuniti and on an
estimate of Filatoi Riuniti's internal production costs. The plant
manager, the accounting department, and you estimate that Filatoi
Riuniti's internal production costs could vary within a 5% range of
the numbers given.

If Filatoi Riuniti's production costs increase by 5%, by how much does
the objective value of the solution change? You should adjust and
re-optimize the model to answer this question.

*** Answer

48924.4906210373 - correct

*Explanation*

Multiply each of Filatoi's production costs by 1.05, and resolve the
optimization model. The objective value of the solution increases to
1,431,468.83, for a change of 48,924.5. This means that the overall
cost is more, which makes sense since it is more expensive to produce
in house.

Note that none of the decision variables change value. So even though
it is more expensive, the strategy does not change if the internal
production costs increase by 5%.

If Filatoi Riuniti's production costs decrease by 5%, by how much does
the objective value of the solution change (in absolute difference)?
You should adjust and re-optimize the model to answer this question.

*** Answer

48924.4906210301 - correct

*Explanation*

Multiply each of Filatoi's production costs by 0.95, and resolve the
optimization model. The objective value of the solution decreases to
1,333,619.84 for a change of 48,924.5. This means that the overall
cost is less, which makes sense since it is less expensive to produce
in house.

Note that none of the decision variables change value. So even though
it is less expensive, the strategy does not change if the internal
production costs decrease by 5%.

** DONE Problem 3.3 - Data estimates (1 point possible)
CLOSED: [2015-08-31 Mon 07:58]

Now you think that the production capacity of one of your local mills,
De Blasi, could vary within a 20% range of the estimated value. In the
current solution, De Blasi produces 2040.125 kg of medium yarn, and
none of the other types of yarn. If De Blasi's capacity is actually
20% higher or lower than the estimated value, will the solution
change? HINT: Think about De Blasi's capacity constraint.

*** Answer

- [ ] Yes
- [X] No

*Explanation*

De Blasi's capacity constraint is not binding in the current
solution. While they have a capacity of 2600 hours, we only use 714
hours. So even if the capacity changes by 20%, the solution will not
change.

* Gasoline Blending [0/1]

One of the earliest and most successful applications of linear
optimization was in the oil industry in the 1950s. According to Bill
Drew, the former manager of research for Exxon Mobil, the company used
linear optimization to "schedule our tanker fleets, design port
facilities, blend gasoline, create financial models, you name it."  In
this problem, we'll use optimization to blend gasoline. (While the
application of this problem is real, the data that we will be using
here has been created for this problem.)

Gasoline blending occurs in oil refineries, where crude oil is
processed and refined into more useful products, such as gasoline and
diesel fuel. We will consider three products: super gasoline, regular
gasoline, and diesel fuel. These can be made by mixing three different
types of crude oil: crude 1, crude 2, and crude 3. Each product is
distinguished by its octane rating, which measures the quality of the
fuel, and its iron content, which is a contaminant in the gas. The
crude oils each have an octane rating and iron content as well. The
following table shows the required octane ratings and iron contents
for each of the products, as well as the known octane ratings and iron
contents of each of the crude oils:

| Product or Oil   | Octane Rating | Iron Content   |
|------------------+---------------+----------------|
| Super Gasoline   | at least 10   | no more than 1 |
| Regular Gasoline | at least 8    | no more than 2 |
| Diesel Fuel      | at least 6    | no more than 1 |
| Crude 1          | 12            | 0.5            |
| Crude 2          | 6             | 2.0            |
| Crude 3          | 8             | 3.0            |

The gasoline produced must meet these standards for octane ratings and
iron content. The octane rating and iron content of a product is the
weighted average of the octane rating and iron content of the crude
oils used to produce it. For example, if we produce super gasoline
using 20 barrels of Crude 1, 5 barrels of Crude 2, and 10 barrels of
Crude 3, the Octane Rating of the super gasoline would be:

(20*12 + 5*6 + 10*8)/35 = 10~

The numerator is the number of barrels of Crude 1 used times the
octane rating of Crude 1, plus the number of barrels of Crude 2 used
times the octane rating of Crude 2, plus the number of barrels of
Crude 3 used times the octane rating of Crude 3. The denominator is
the total number of barrels used.

Similarly, the iron content of the super gasoline would be:

~(20*0.5 + 5*2.0 + 10*3.0)/35 = 1.43~

The objective of the oil company is to maximize profit. The following
table gives the sales price (revenue) for one barrel of each of the
products:

| Product          | Sales Price |
|------------------+-------------|
| Super Gasoline   | $70         |
| Regular Gasoline | $60         |
| Diesel Fuel      | $50         |

And the following table gives the purchase price for one barrel of
each of the crude oils:

| Oil     | Purchase Price |
|---------+----------------|
| Crude 1 | $45            |
| Crude 2 | $35            |
| Crude 3 | $25            |

We would like to maximize the amount made by selling the products,
minus the amount it costs to buy the crude oils.

The company can only buy 5,000 barrels of each type of crude oil, and
can process no more than 14,000 barrels total of crude oil. One barrel
of crude oil makes one barrel of gasoline or fuel (nothing is lost in
the conversion).

How many barrels of each type of crude oil should the company use to
make each product? Formulate this problem as a linear optimization
problem, and solve it in LibreOffice (or in the spreadsheet software
you are using). The first problem below asks about the formulation,
and the second problem asks about the solution. So if you get stuck in
formulating the problem, try working through Problem 1 below.

HINT: When trying to solve this problem, your solver might complain
that it is nonlinear. Be careful how you construct the octane and iron
constraints. If x, y, and z are variables, and you are trying to add
the constraint:

~12x+6y+8zx+y+z≥10~

It needs to be formulated as:

~12x+6y+8z≥10(x+y+z)~

This is because you can only add variables in linear constraints. Note
that this is the same constraint - we just multiplied both sides of
the denominator of the fraction.

Explanation

The are nine decision variables in this optimization model - one for each product and each type of crude oil. So we should have one decision variable for the amount of Crude 1 to use in Super Gasoline, one decision variable for the amount of Crude 2 to use in Super Gasoline, etc.

Explanation

After setting up and solving this problem in LibreOffice, the objective value of the solution is $375,000.

To provide an explanation of the formulas used in the model, assume that your decision variables are set up in your spreadsheet like this:
	A 	B 	C 	D

The company is unhappy with this solution, because they are exceeding the customer demand for regular gasoline. They estimate that the customer demand for super gasoline is 3,000 barrels, the customer demand for regular gasoline is 2,000 barrels, and the customer demand for diesel fuel is 1,000 barrels. They don't want to produce more than the customer demand, since they will lose revenue.

** TODO Problem 3.1 - Sensitivity Analysis and Shadow Prices (1 point possible)

The following are the shadow prices for each of the demand constraints:

Super gasoline demand shadow price = 29

Regular gasoline demand shadow price = 27

Diesel fuel demand shadow price = 9

The super gasoline shadow price holds to an allowable increase of 1250, the regular gasoline shadow price holds to an allowable increase of 2500, and the diesel fuel shadow price holds to an allowable increase of 1250. The "allowable increase" is the amount that you can increase the right-hand side and still use this shadow price. For a larger increase, the shadow price will change, and you have to resolve the model to get the new shadow price.

Please answer the following questions without re-solving the optimization model.

What does a shadow price of 29 for the super gasoline demand constraint mean?
It is profitable to increase the super gasoline demand by 29 units, and then it is not profitable.
It is profitable to decrease the super gasoline demand by 29 units, and then it is not profitable.
For 10 additional barrels of demand of super gasoline, the total profit will decrease by 29.
For 10 additional barrels of demand of super gasoline, the total profit will increase by 29.
For one additional barrel of demand of super gasoline, the total profit will decrease by 29.
For one additional barrel of demand of super gasoline, the total profit will increase by 29.

Explanation

The shadow price of a constraint means that for one unit increase in the right hand side of the constraint, the shadow price will be added to the objective value. So, a shadow price of 29 for the super gasoline demand constraint means that for one additional barrel of demand of super gasoline, the total profit will increase by 29.

* Even' star organic farm (OPTIONAL) [0/14]

** Important Note

This problem is optional, and will not count towards your grade. We
have created this problem to give you extra practice with the topics
covered in this unit.

Even' Star Organic Farm was founded in 1997 by Brett Grohsgal, a
former chef in Washington DC. The company owns a 104-acre farm in
southern Maryland, and grows and sells organic produce. For more
information, see [[https://www.facebook.com/EvenStarOrganicFarm/info][Even' Star's Facebook]] page. This problem describes
the business issues faced by Brett, and the data is based on actual
observations.

Brett has decided to grow eight different types of produce: large
tomatoes, small tomatoes, watermelon, okra, basil, cucumbers, sweet
potatoes, and winter squash. He distrbutes his produce through three
different channels: Restaurants, Community-Supported Agriculture, and
Farmers' Markets.

Initially, he sold exclusively to restuarants. He knows of 20
restaurants that will buy his produce from his connections as a former
chef. As his farm expanded, he also started selling his produce at a
local farmers' market, where he can command a higher price. Recently,
he has also started selling through Community Supported Agriculture
(CSA), a program in which individuals pay a $400 subscription price to
get a box of produce each week for 15 weeks. He currently knows of 90
individuals who are interested in buying his produce through the CSA
program.

Brett has a limited amount of produce that he can sell each season,
and he needs to decide how much produce to sell through each channel
(restaurants, CSA, or farmers' markets).

** TODO Problem 1.1 - Formulating the Problem

Let's formulate Brett's problem as a linear optimization problem. The spreadsheet EvenStarFarm.ods for LibreOffice or OpenOffice, and EvenStarFarm.xlsx for Microsoft Excel, contains the data for the problem, and has set up the decision variables and objective for you.

The decision variables in our problem are the number of cases of each type of produce to sell in each channel (there are 24 decision variables). They are highlighted in yellow in the spreadsheet.

Brett's objective is to maximize total profit (total revenue minus total cost). In the spreadsheet EvenStarFarm, the objective is highlighted in blue.

To compute the total revenue, we multiply the number of cases of each type of produce distributed in each channel by the price that Brett sells it for. The price of a case of each type of produce in each of the different channels is listed in cells C6:E13 of the spreadsheet.

The total cost is composed of two parts: a variable cost per client, and an entry cost for being in the particular channel. The entry costs are listed in cells B20:D20.

To compute the total variable cost for each restaurant client, we use the information that each restaurant client will buy 119 cases of produce during the season. So, the total number of restaurant clients served in a season can be computed as the total number of cases sold to restaurants, divided by 119. (Note that the number of restuarant clients Brett gives produce to could be fractional (like 16.57). This is a simplification we'll make for this problem, so please ignore the fact that this number should be integer. We'll see next week how you can add integer restrictions to an optimization model.)

To compute the total variable cost for CSA clients, we need to know that each CSA customer will buy $400 worth of produce during the season. So, the total number of CSA clients served can be computed by dividing the total dollar amount sent to CSA customers by $400. (Note that the number of CSA clients Brett gives produce to could be fractional (like 16.57). This is a simplification we'll make for this problem, so please ignore the fact that this number should be integer. We'll see next week how you can add integer restrictions to an optimization model.)

There is no variable cost for farmers' market clients.

Which of the following spreadsheet formulas computes the total variable cost for the restaurant channel? Use the location of the data and variables in the spreadsheet EvenStarFarm.
B19*SUM(B26:B33)
B19/119
B19*(SUM(B26:B33)/119)
SUM(B26:B33)/119
- unanswered

Explanation

The variable cost per restaurant client is located in cell B19. We need to multiply this by the total number of restuarant clients, which can be computed by summing the total number of cases sent to restaurant clients, and dividing by 119, or SUM(B26:B33)/119. So the correct answer is B19*(SUM(B26:B33)/119).

Explanation

The variable cost per CSA client is given in cell C19. We need to multiply this by the total dollar amount sent to CSA customers, divided by $400, which is computed is LibreOffice as SUMPRODUCT(C26:C33;D6:D13)/400. So the total variable cost is C19*(SUMPRODUCT(C26:C33;D6:D13)/400).

Explanation

We need to add constraints to restrict the total number of cases sold to each client (B26:D26) to be greater than or equal to zero, and we need to make sure that the total number of cases sold (SUM(B26:D26)) is no more than the total number produced, B6.

Compared to the old objective value of $49,956.39, this is an increase in profit of $50,181.76 - $49,956.39 = $225.37. Since this is less than the cost of the truck, he shouldn't buy the larger truck.

** TODO Problem 3.2 - Sensitivity Analysis

One of Brett's workers has offered to use his truck to help Brett transport 200 more cases of produce to the farmer's market (for a total of 800 cases). Which of the following choices would increase Brett's profit? Select all that apply.
Hire the worker, and pay him $300 for helping.
Hire the worker, and pay him $150 for helping.
Not hiring the worker.
- unanswered

Explanation

We saw in the previous question that increasing the farmers' market cases to 800 increases profits by $225.37. Thus Brett should hire the worker, and pay him $150, since that will give him an additional profit of $225.37 - $150.00 = $75.37.

** TODO Problem 3.3 - Sensitivity Analysis

Now suppose that Brett has found 10 more customers who would like to join the CSA program, for a total of 100 potential CSA customers. Should he sell produce to these customers? If you have changed any values in the constraints, change them back to their original values before answering this question (600 cases at the farmers' market).
Yes, adding all of these extra customers will increase his profit.
Yes, adding some of these extra customers will increase his profit.
No, he shouldn't sell produce to any of these customers.
- unanswered

Explanation

Since the constraint for CSA customers is not binding (we sell to 65.88 customers, when we know of 90) it is not beneficial to add 10 more CSA customers.

** TODO Problem 3.4 - Sensitivity Analysis

Now suppose that Brett has purchased 5 additional acres of land, which allows him to produce 10 additional cases of one of his vegetables. Which vegetable should he plant on these 5 additional acres?

If you have changed any values in the constraints, change them back to their original values before answering this question (600 cases at the farmers' market, and 90 potential CSA customers). Assume for this problem that the production cost is the same for all types of produce. For your reference, here is a list of the number of cases of each type of produce that Brett currently produces: 406 cases of Large Tomatoes, 608 cases of Small Tomatoes, 167 cases of Watermelon, 76 cases of Okra, 72 cases of Basil, 251 cases of Cucumbers, 107 cases of Sweet Potatoes, and 133 cases of Winter Squash.
Tomatoes (large)
Tomatoes (small)
Watermelon
Okra
Basil
Cucumber
Sweet Potatoes
Winter Squash
- unanswered

Explanation

If you increase the total number of cases of each type of produce one at a time by 10, the large tomatoes give the largest increase in the objective function value. Thus, Brett should plant large tomatoes on the additional acres of land.
