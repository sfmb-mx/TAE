* Election Forecasting Revisited

In the recitation from Unit 3, we used logistic regression on polling
data in order to construct US presidential election predictions. We
separated our data into a training set, containing data from 2004 and
2008 polls, and a test set, containing the data from 2012 polls. We
then proceeded to develop a logistic regression model to forecast the
2012 US presidential election.

In this homework problem, we'll revisit our logistic regression model
from Unit 3, and learn how to plot the output on a map of the United
States. Unlike what we did in the Crime lecture, this time we'll be
plotting predictions rather than data!

First, load the ~ggplot2~, ~maps~, and ~ggmap~ packages using the
library function. All three packages should be installed on your
computer from lecture, but if not, you may need to install them too
using the ~install.packages~ function.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Loading the necessary libraries...")
  library(ggplot2)
  library(maps)
  library(ggmap)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Loading the necessary libraries...

Then, load the US map and save it to the variable statesMap, like we
did during the Crime lecture:

~statesMap = map_data("state")~

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Load the US map in R...")
  statesMap <- map_data("state")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Load the US map in R...

The maps package contains other built-in maps, including a US county
map, a world map, and maps for France and Italy.

** Problem 1.1 - Drawing a Map of the US (1 point possible)

If you look at the structure of the statesMap data frame using the ~str~
function, you should see that there are 6 variables. One of the
variables, group, defines the different shapes or polygons on the
map. Sometimes a state may have multiple groups, for example, if it
includes islands.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Showing the structure of stateMap:")
  str(statesMap)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Showing the structure of stateMap:

:  $ region   : chr  "alabama" "alabama" "alabama" "alabama" ...
:  $ subregion: chr  NA NA NA NA ...

*** Question

How many different groups are there?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The number of groups:")
  str(factor(statesMap$group))

  writeLines("\n :: Another useful way:")

 :: Yet another way to calculate:
[1] 63
#+end_example

**** Answer

63

*Explanation*

You can count the number of different values of the group variable by
using the command ~table(statesMap$group)~. There are $63$ different
values.

Alternatively, you could use the command

~length(table(statesMap$group))~

as a shortcut to counting the number of groups in the table output.

The variable ~order~ defines the order to connect the points within
each group, and the variable ~region~ gives the name of the state.

** Problem 1.2 - Drawing a Map of the US (1 point possible)

You can draw a map of the United States by typing the following in
your R console:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="USmapHW01" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  ggplot(statesMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
          geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black")
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  United States map in R
#+NAME:     fig:USmapHW01
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/USmapHW01.png]]

We specified two colors in geom_polygon -- ~fill~ and ~color~. Which
one defined the color of the outline of the states?

*** Answer

- [ ] fill
- [X] color color - correct
- [ ] Neither

*Explanation*

In our plot, the states are outlined in black, which is the color we
specified for the option ~color~. To confirm that this is changing the
outline color of the states, you can try re-running the command with a
different color:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="USMapHW02" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  ggplot(statesMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
          geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "dark red")
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  United States map in other outline color
#+NAME:     fig:USMapHW02
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/USMapHW02.png]]

** Problem 2.1 - Coloring the States by Predictions (2 points possible)

Now, let's color the map of the US according to our 2012 US
presidential election predictions from the Unit 3 Recitation. We'll
rebuild the model here, using the dataset ~PollingImputed.csv~. Be sure
to use this file so that you don't have to redo the imputation to fill
in the missing values, like we did in the Unit 3 Recitation.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  library(parallel)

  if(!file.exists("../data")) {
          dir.create("../data")
  }

  fileUrl <- "https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/PollingImputed.csv"
  fileName <- "PollingImputed.csv"
  dataPath <- "../data"

  filePath <- paste(dataPath, fileName, sep = "/")

  if(!file.exists(filePath)) {
          download.file(fileUrl, destfile = filePath, method = "curl")
  }

  writeLines("\n :: File downloaded...")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: File downloaded...

Load the data using the ~read.csv~ function, and call it ~polling~. Then
split the data using the subset function into a training set called
~Train~ that has observations from 2004 and 2008, and a testing set
called ~Test~ that has observations from 2012.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("    Loading the imputed data into their data frame.")
  polling <- read.table("../data/PollingImputed.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
  str(polling)
  table(polling$Year)
  summary(polling)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Splitting the dataset in two data frames ~Train~ and ~Test~ data frames.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Subset data into training set and test set")
  Train <- subset(polling, Year == 2004 | Year == 2008)
  Test <- subset(polling, Year == 2012)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Subset data into training set and test set

Note that we only have 45 states in our testing set, since we are
missing observations for Alaska, Delaware, Alabama, Wyoming, and
Vermont, so these states will not appear colored in our map.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Revising the Testing data frame structure:")
  str(Test)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

 :: Revising the Testing data frame structure:
'data.frame':	45 obs. of  7 variables:
 $ State     : Factor w/ 50 levels "Alabama","Alaska",..: 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 ...
 $ Year      : int  2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 ...

 $ Republican: int  1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ...
#+end_example

Then, create a logistic regression model and make predictions on the
test set using the following commands:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Creating the Logistic Regression model...")
  mod2 <- glm(Republican ~ SurveyUSA + DiffCount, data = Train,
              family = "binomial")

  writeLines("\n :: Making preditions from Testing data set...")
  TestPrediction <- predict(mod2, newdata = Test, type = "response")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Creating the Logistic Regression model...
:
:  :: Making preditions from Testing data set...

~TestPrediction~ gives the predicted probabilities for each state, but
let's also create a vector of Republican/Democrat predictions by using
the following command:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Creting binary preditions with a threshold of 50%...")
  TestPredictionBinary <- as.numeric(TestPrediction > 0.5)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Creting binary preditions with a threshold of 50%...

Now, put the predictions and state labels in a data.frame so that we
can use ~ggplot~:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: New data frame for plotting purposes...")
  predictionDataFrame <- data.frame(TestPrediction,
                                    TestPredictionBinary, Test$State)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: New data frame for plotting purposes...

To make sure everything went smoothly, answer the following
questions.

*** Question a

For how many states is our binary prediction 1 (for 2012),
corresponding to Republican?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Number of states with TestPredictionbinary == 1:")
  nrow(subset(predictionDataFrame, predictionDataFrame$TestPredictionBinary == 1))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Number of states with TestPredictionbinary == 1:
: [1] 22

**** Answer

22

*** Question

What is the average predicted probability of our model (on the Test
set, for 2012)?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The average predicted probability of our model:")
  mean(predictionDataFrame$TestPrediction)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: The average predicted probability of our model:
: [1] 0.4852626

**** Answer

0.4852626

*Explanation*

You can create the data frame predictionDataFrame by running the
following lines of R code:

~polling = read.csv("PollingImputed.csv")~

~Train = subset(polling, Year < 2012)~

~Test = subset(polling, Year == 2012)~

~mod2 = glm(Republican~SurveyUSA+DiffCount, data=Train, family="binomial")~

~TestPrediction = predict(mod2, newdata=Test, type="response")~

TestPredictionBinary = as.numeric(TestPrediction > 0.5)~

~predictionDataFrame = data.frame(TestPrediction, TestPredictionBinary, Test$State)~

You can answer the two questions with the functions
~table(TestPredictionBinary)~ and ~mean(TestPrediction)~.

** Problem 2.2 - Coloring the States by Predictions (2 points possible)

Now, we need to merge ~predictionDataFrame~ with the map data
~statesMap~, like we did in lecture. Before doing so, we need to
convert the ~Test.State~ variable to lowercase, so that it matches the
region variable in ~statesMap~. Do this by typing the following in your
R console:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: convert the Test.State variable to lowercase...")
  predictionDataFrame$region <- tolower(predictionDataFrame$Test.State)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: convert the Test.State variable to lowercase...

Now, merge the two data frames using the following command:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Merging the two data frames...")
  predictionMap <- merge(statesMap, predictionDataFrame, by = "region")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Merging the two data frames...

Lastly, we need to make sure the observations are in order so that the
map is drawn properly, by typing the following:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Ordering the map data...")
  predictionMap <- predictionMap[order(predictionMap$order),]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Ordering the map data...

*** Question

How many observations are there in ~predictionMap~?

**** Answer

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Number of observations in the predition map:")
  nrow(predictionMap)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Number of observations in the predition map:
: [1] 15034

*** Question

How many observations are there in ~statesMap~?

**** Answer

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Number of observations in the states map:")
  nrow(statesMap)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Number of observations in the states map:
: [1] 15537

*Explanation*

If you type ~str(predictionMap)~, you should see that there are $15034$
observations, and if you type ~str(statesMap)~ you should see that there
are $15537$ observations.

** Problem 2.3 - Coloring the States by Predictions (1 point possible)

When we merged the data in the previous problem, it caused the number
of observations to change. Why? Check out the help page for merge by
typing ?merge to help you answer this question.

*** Answer

- [ ] Merging the data just combines the two data frames like it would
  if we used rbind, so the number of observations increased.

- [ ] We have more observations for each state now, because some
  observations have the statesMap data, and some observations have the
  prediction data.

- [X] Because we only make predictions for 45 states, we no longer
  have observations for some of the states. These observations were
  removed in the merging process.

- [ ] We merged the observations for which our predictions are
  identical.

*Explanation*

When we merge data, it only merged the observations that exist in both
data sets. So since we are merging based on the region variable, we
will lose all observations that have a value of ~region~ that doesn't
exist in both data frames.

You can change this default behavior by using the ~all.x~ and ~all.y~
arguments of the merge function. For more information, look at the
help page for the merge function by typing ~?merge~ in your R console.

** Problem 2.4 - Coloring the States by Predictions (1 point possible)

Now we are ready to color the US map with our predictions! You can
color the states according to our binary predictions by typing the
following in your R console:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="USElectionsPredictions01" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill =
          TestPredictionBinary)) +
          geom_polygon(color = "black")
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  US Presidential predictions map v1
#+NAME:     fig:USElectionsPredictions01
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/USElectionsPredictions01.png]]

The states appear light blue and dark blue in this map. Which color
represents a Republican prediction?

*** Answer

- [X] Light blue
- [ ] Dark blue

*Explanation*

Our logistic regression model assigned $1$ to *Republican* and $0$ to
*Democrat*. As we can see from the legend, $1$ corresponds to a *light
blue* color on the map and $0$ corresponds to a *dark blue* color on
the map.

** Problem 2.5 - Coloring the States by Predictions (1 point possible)

We see that the legend displays a *blue* gradient for outcomes between
$0$ and $1$. However, when plotting the binary predictions there are
only two possible outcomes: $0$ or $1$. Let's replot the map with
discrete outcomes. We can also change the color scheme to *blue* and
*red*, to match the *blue* color associated with the *Democratic
Party* in the US and the *red* color associated with the *Republican
Party* in the US. This can be done with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="USElectionsPredictions02" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPredictionBinary)) +
          geom_polygon(color = "black") +
          scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", guide =
          "legend", breaks= c(0,1), labels = c("Democrat",
                                               "Republican"), name =

Alternatively, we could plot the probabilities instead of the binary
predictions. Change the ~plot~ command above to instead color the
states by the variable ~TestPrediction~. You should see a gradient of
colors ranging from *red* to *blue*. Do the colors of the states in
the map for ~TestPrediction~ look different from the colors of the
states in the map with ~TestPredictionBinary~? Why or why not?

NOTE: If you have a hard time seeing the red/blue gradient, feel free
to change the color scheme, by changing the arguments ~low = "blue"~ and
~high = "red"~ to colors of your choice (to see all of the color options
in R, type colors() in your R console). You can even change it to a
gray scale, by changing the low and high colors to ~gray~ and
~black~.

*** Answer

- [X] The two maps look very similar. This is because most of our
  predicted probabilities are close to 0 or close to 1. The two maps
  look very similar. This is because most of our predicted
  probabilities are close to 0 or close to 1. - correct

- [ ] The two maps look very similar. This is because ~TestPrediction~
  and TestPredictionBinary have the exact same values.

- [ ] The two maps look very different. This is because we have
  switched from plotting discrete values to plotting continuous
  values.

- [ ] The two maps look very different. This is because our predicted
  probabilites have a wide range of values, and we were not sure about
  many states.

*Explanation*

This plot can be generated by using the command:

~ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill =~
~TestPrediction)) + geom_polygon(color = "black") +~
~scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", name = "Prediction~
~2012")~

The only state that appears *purple* (the color between *red* and
*blue*) is the state of Iowa, so the maps look very similar. If you
take a look at ~TestPrediction~, you can see that most of our
predicted probabilities are very close to $0$ or very close to $1$. In
fact, we don't have a single predicted probability between $0.065$ and
$0.93$.

** Problem 3.1 - Understanding the Predictions (1 point possible)

In the 2012 election, the state of *Florida* ended up being a very close
race. It was ultimately won by the *Democratic* party. Did we predict
this state correctly or incorrectly? To see the names and locations of
the different states, take a look at the World Atlas map here.

*** Answer

- [ ] We correctly predicted that this state would be won by the
  Democratic party.

- [X] We incorrectly predicted this state by predicting that it would
  be won by the Republican party.

*Explanation*

In our prediction map, the state of Florida is colored *red*, meaning
that we predicted Republican. So *we incorrectly predicted this
state*.

** Problem 3.2 - Understanding the Predictions (2 points possible)

*** Question a

What was our predicted probability for the state of Florida?

**** Answer

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The predicted probability for Florida:")
  head(predictionMap[predictionMap$region == "florida", ], 1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

:      TestPredictionBinary Test.State
: 1150                    1    Florida

Predicted probability: $0.9640395$

*** Question b

What does this imply?

**** Answer

- [ ] Our prediction model did a good job of correctly predicting the
  state of Florida, and we were very confident in our prediction.

- [ ] Our prediction model did a good job of correctly predicting the
  state of Florida, but we were not very confident in the prediction.

- [ ] Our prediction model did not do a very good job of correctly
  predicting the state of Florida, but we were not very confident in
  our prediction.

- [X] Our prediction model did not do a very good job of correctly
  predicting the state of Florida, and we were very confident in our
  incorrect prediction.

*Explanation*

We predicted Republican for the state of Florida with high
probability, meaning that we were very confident in our incorrect
prediction! Historically, Florida is usually a close race, but our
model doesn't know this. The model only uses polling results for the
particular year. For Florida in 2012, Survey USA predicted a tie, but
other polls predicted Republican, so our model predicted Republican.

** Problem 4 - Parameter Settings

In this part, we'll explore what the different parameter settings of
~geom_polygon~ do. Throughout the problem, use the help page for
~geom_polygon~, which can be accessed by ?geom_polygon. To see more
information about a certain parameter, just type a question mark and
then the parameter name to get the help page for that
parameter. Experiment with different parameter settings to try and
replicate the plots!

We'll be asking questions about the following three plots:

*Plot (1)*

[[../graphs/ElectionForecastingMap1.png]]

*Plot (2)*

[[../graphs/ElectionForecastingMap2.png]]

*Plot (3)*

[[../graphs/ElectionForecastingMap3.png]]

Recreating *plot (1)*

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="RecreatingPlot01" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPrediction)) +
            geom_polygon(color = "black", linetype = 3) +

** Problem 4.1 - Parameter Settings (2/2 points)

Plots (1) and (2) were created by setting different parameters of
geom_polygon to the value 3.

*** Question

What is the name of the parameter we set to have value 3 to create
plot (1)?

**** Answer

~linetype~

*** Question

What is the name of the parameter we set to have value 3 to create
plot (2)?

**** Answer

~size~

*Explanation*

The first plot can be generated by setting the parameter ~linetype=3~:

~ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill =~
~TestPrediction))+~
~geom_polygon(color = "black", linetype=3) +~
~scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", guide~
~= "legend", breaks = c(0,1), labels = c("Democrat", "Republican") , name~
~= "Prediction 2012")~

The second plot can be generated by setting the parameter ~size = 3~:

~ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill =~
~TestPrediction))+ geom_polygon(color = "black", size=3) +~
~scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", guide~
~= "legend", breaks= c(0,1), labels = c("Democrat", "Republican"),name~
~= "Prediction 2012")~

** Problem 4.2 - Parameter Settings (1 point possible)

*** Question

Plot (3) was created by changing the value of a different geom_polygon
parameter to have value 0.3. Which parameter did we use?

**** Answer

*alpha*

*Explanation*

Plot (3) can be created by changing the alpha parameter:

~ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill =~
~TestPrediction))+ geom_polygon(color = "black", alpha=0.3) +~
~scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", guide~
~= "legend", breaks= c(0,1), labels = c("Democrat", "Republican"),name~
~= "Prediction 2012")~

The ~alpha~ parameter controls the transparency or darkness of the
color. A smaller value of alpha will make the colors lighter.

* Visualizing Network Data

The cliche goes that the world is an increasingly interconnected
place, and the connections between different entities are often best
represented with a graph. Graphs are comprised of vertices (also often
called "nodes") and edges connecting those nodes. In this assignment,
we will learn how to visualize networks using the ~igraph~ package in
R.

For this assignment, we will visualize social networking data using
anonymized data from Facebook; this data was originally curated in a
[[http://i.stanford.edu/~julian/pdfs/nips2012.pdf][recent paper]] about computing social circles in social networks. In our
visualizations, the vertices in our network will represent Facebook
users and the edges will represent these users being Facebook friends
with each other.

The first file we will use, [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/edges.csv][edges.csv]], contains variables ~V1~ and ~V2~,
which label the endpoints of edges in our network. Each row represents
a pair of users in our graph who are Facebook friends. For a pair of
friends A and B, ~edges.csv~ will only contain a single row -- the
smaller identifier will be listed first in this row. From this row, we
will know that A is friends with B and B is friends with A.

The second file, [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/users.csv][users.csv]], contains information about the Facebook
users, who are the vertexes in our network. This file contains the
following variables:

- *id*: A unique identifier for this user; this is the value that
  appears in the rows of ~edges.csv~

- *gender*: An identifier for the gender of a user taking the values A
  and B. Because the data is anonymized, we don't know which value
  refers to males and which value refers to females.

- *school*: An identifier for the school the user attended taking the
  values A and AB (users with AB attended school A as well as another
  school B). Because the data is anonymized, we don't know the schools
  represented by A and B.

- *locale*: An identifier for the locale of the user taking the values
  A and B. Because the data is anonymized, we don't know which value
  refers to what locale.

*Explanation*

From ~str(users)~ or ~nrow(users)~, we see that there are 59 Facebook
users in this dataset.

*** Question b

In our dataset, what is the average number of friends per user? Hint:
this question is tricky, and it might help to start by thinking about
a small example with two users who are friends.

**** Answer

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Number of frienship relationships:")
  nrow(edges)

  writeLines("\n :: Number of users:")
  nrow(users)

  writeLines("\n :: Average number of friends per user:")
  (2 * nrow(edges)) / nrow(users)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Number of frienship relationships:
: [1] 146
:
:  :: Number of users:
: [1] 59
:
:  :: Average number of friends per user:
: [1] 4.949153

*Explanation*

From ~str(edges)~ or ~nrow(edges)~, we see that there are $146 pairs
of users in our dataset who are Facebook friends. However, each pair
$(A, B)$ must be counted twice, because $B$ is a friend of $A$ and $A$
is a friend of $B$. To think of this in simpler terms, consider a
network with just new people, $A$ and $B$, and a single edge $(A,
B)$. Even though there are two vertexes and one edge, each user has on
average one friend.

For our network, the average number of friends per user is

$$
\frac{292}{59} = 4.95
$$

Finally, note that in all likelihood these users have a much higher
number of Facebook friends. We are computing here the average number
of people in this dataset who are their friends, instead of the
average total number of Facebook friends.

** Problem 2.1 - Creating a Network (1 point possible)

We will be using the ~igraph~ package to visualize networks; install
and load this package using the ~install.packages~ and ~library~
commands.

We can create a new graph object using the ~graph.data.frame()~
function. Based on ~?graph.data.frame~, which of the following
commands will create a graph ~g~ describing our social network, with
the attributes of each user correctly loaded?

Note: A directed graph is one where the edges only go one way -- they
point from one vertex to another. The other option is an undirected
graph, which means that the relations between the vertexes are
symmetric.

+ ... omitted several edges
#+end_example

*Explanation*

From ~?graph.data.frame~, we can see that the function expects the
first two columns of parameter d to specify the edges in the graph --
our edges object fits this description.

Our edges are undirected -- if $A$ is a Facebook friend of $B$ then
$B$ is a Facebook friend of $A$. Therefore, we set the directed
parameter to ~FALSE~.

The vertices parameter expects a data frame where the first column is
a vertex id and the remaining columns are properties of vertices in
our graph. This is the case with our users data frame.

** Problem 2.2 - Creating a Network (2 points possible)

Use the correct command from Problem 2.1 to load the graph ~g~.

Now, we want to plot our graph. By default, the vertices are large and
have text labels of a user's identifier. Because this would clutter
the output, we will plot with no text labels and smaller vertices:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="FBFriendshipGraph01" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  plot(g, vertex.size = 5, vertex.label = NA)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots

In this graph, there are a number of groups of nodes where all the
nodes in each group are connected but the groups are disjoint from one
another, forming *islands* in the graph. Such groups are called
~connected components~, or ~components~ for short.

*** Question a

How many connected components with at least 2 nodes are there in the
graph?

**** Answer

4

*Explanation*

In addition to the large connected component, there is a 4-node
component and two 2-node components.


*** Question b

How many users are there with no friends in the network?

**** Answer

7

*Explanation*

There are 7 nodes that are not connected to any other nodes. Each
forms a 1-node connected component.

** Problem 2.3 - Creating a Network (1 point possible)

In our graph, the *degree* of a node is its number of friends. We have
already seen that some nodes in our graph have degree 0 (these are the
nodes with no friends), while others have much higher degree. We can
use ~degree(g)~ to compute the degree of all the nodes in our graph
~g~.

*** Question

How many users are friends with 10 or more other Facebook users in
this network?

   50     9
#+end_example

9 users have equal or more to 10 friends.

*Explanation*

From ~table(degree(g))~ or ~table(degree(g) >= 10)~, we can see that
there are 9 users with 10 or more friends in this network.

** Problem 2.4 - Creating a Network (2 points possible)

In a network, it's often visually useful to draw attention to
*important* nodes in the network. While this might mean different
things in different contexts, in a social network we might consider a
user with a large number of friends to be an *important user*. From the
previous problem, we know this is the same as saying that nodes with a
high degree are important users.

To visually draw attention to these nodes, we will change the size of
the vertices so the vertices with high degrees are larger. To do this,
we will change the "size" attribute of the vertices of our graph to be
an increasing function of their degrees:

~V(g)$size = degree(g)/ 2 + 2~

Now that we have specified the vertex size of each vertex, we will no
longer use the ~vertex.size~ parameter when we plot our graph:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="FBFriendshipGraph02" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  V(g)$size = degree(g)/2+2
  plot(g, vertex.label = NA)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  Facebook friendship graph v2
#+NAME:     fig:FBFriendshipGraph02

*** Question a

What is the largest size we assigned to any node in our graph?

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: The largest size assigned to a node:")
  sort(V(g)$size, decreasing = TRUE)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

*11 is the largest size assigned to a node.*

*** Question b

What is the smallest size we assigned to any node in our graph?

**** Answer

*2 is the smallest size assigned to a node.*

*Explanation*

From ~table(degree(g))~ or ~summary(degree(g))~, we see that the maximum
degree of any node in the graph is $18$ and the minimum degree of any
node is $0$. Therefore, the maximum size of any point is ~18/2+2=11~, and
the minimum size is ~0/2+2=2~.

** Problem 3.1 - Coloring Vertices (1 point possible)

Thus far, we have changed the *size* attributes of our
vertices. However, we can also change the colors of vertices to
capture additional information about the Facebook users we are
depicting.

When changing the size of nodes, we first obtained the vertices of our
graph with ~V(g)~ and then accessed the the size attribute with
~V(g)$size~. To change the color, we will update the attribute
~V(g)$color~.

To color the vertices based on the gender of the user, we will need
access to that variable. When we created our graph ~g~, we provided it
with the data frame users, which had variables ~gender~, ~school~, and
~locale~. These are now stored as attributes ~V(g)$gender~, ~V(g)$school~,
and ~V(g)$locale~.

We can update the colors by setting the color to black for all
vertices, than setting it to red for the vertices with gender A and
setting it to gray for the vertices with gender B:

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Assigning black color to the nodes...")
  V(g)$color <- "black"

  writeLines("\n :: Assigning red color to gender A...")
  V(g)$color[V(g)$gender == "A"] <- "red"

  writeLines("\n :: Assigning gray color to gender B...")
  V(g)$color[V(g)$gender == "B"] <- "gray"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Assigning black color to the nodes...
:
:  :: Assigning red color to gender A...
:
:  :: Assigning gray color to gender B...

*** Question

Plot the resulting graph. What is the gender of the users with the
highest degree in the graph?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="FBFriendshipGraph03" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  plot(g, vertex.label = NA)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  Facebook friendship graph v3
#+NAME:     fig:FBFriendshipGraph03
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/FBFriendshipGraph03.png]]

**** Answer

- [ ] Missing gender value
- [ ] Gender A
- [X] Gender B

*Explanation*

After updating ~V(g)$color~, run ~plot(g, vertex.label=NA)~ to plot
the graph. All the largest nodes (the ones with the highest degree)
are colored *gray*, which corresponds to Gender *B*.

** Problem 3.2 - Coloring Vertices (2 points possible)

Now, color the vertices based on the school that each user in our
network attended.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Assigning black color to the nodes...")
  V(g)$color <- "black"

  writeLines("\n :: Assigning blue color to school A...")
  V(g)$color[V(g)$school == "A"] <- "blue"

  writeLines("\n :: Assigning red color to school AB...")
  V(g)$color[V(g)$school == "AB"] <- "red"
#+end_src

[[../graphs/FBFriendshipGraph04.png]]

Are the two users who attended both schools A and B Facebook friends
with each other?

**** Answer

- [X] Yes Yes - correct
- [ ] No

*** Question

What best describes the users with highest degree?

- [ ] None of the high-degree users attended school A

- [X] Some, but not all, of the high-degree users attended school A
  Some, but not all, of the high-degree users attended school A -
  correct

- [ ] All of the high-degree users attended school A

*Explanation*

As with coloring by gender, we will set the color for all vertices to
black, and then we will set the color for students from school A to
red and the color for students from schools A and B to gray. Finally
we will plot the updated graph:

~(V(g)$color = "black")~

~(V(g)$color[V(g)$school == "A"] = "red")~

~(V(g)$color[V(g)$school == "AB"] = "gray")~

~plot(g, vertex.label=NA)~

The two students who attended schools A and B are colored gray; we can
see from the graph that they are Facebook friends (aka they are
connected by an edge). The high-degree users (depicted by the large
nodes) are a mixture of red and black color, meaning some of these
users attended school A and other did not.

** Problem 3.3 - Coloring Vertices (2 points possible)

Now, color the vertices based on the locale of the user.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Assigning black color to the nodes...")
  V(g)$color <- "black"

  writeLines("\n :: Assigning green color to locale A...")
  V(g)$color[V(g)$locale == "A"] <- "green"

  writeLines("\n :: Assigning red color to locale B...")
  V(g)$color[V(g)$locale == "B"] <- "red"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Assigning black color to the nodes...
:
:  :: Assigning green color to locale A...
:
:  :: Assigning red color to locale B...

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="FBFriendshipGraph05" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  plot(g, vertex.label = NA)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

*** Question

The large connected component is most associated with which locale?

**** Answer

- [ ] Locale A
- [X] Locale B

*** Question

The 4-user connected component is most associated with which locale?

**** Answer

- [X] Locale A
- [ ] Locale B

*Explanation*

As with the other coloring tasks, we will set the color for all
vertices to black, and then we will set the color for users from
locale A to red and the color for users from locale B to gray. Finally
we will plot the updated graph:

~(V(g)$color = "black")~

~(V(g)$color[V(g)$locale == "A"] = "red")~

~(V(g)$color[V(g)$locale == "B"] = "gray")~

~plot(g, vertex.label=NA)~

Nearly all of the vertices from the large connected component are
colored gray, indicating users from Locale B. Meanwhile, all the
vertices in the 4-user connected component are colored red, indicating
users from Locale A.

** Problem 4 - Other Plotting Options (2 points possible)

The help page is a helpful tool when making visualizations. Answer the
following questions with the help of ~?igraph.plotting~ and
experimentation in your R console.

*** Question

Which ~igraph~ plotting function would enable us to plot our graph in
3-D?

**** Answer

We need to install the ~rgl~ package.

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Install new package: rgl ...")
  ## install.packages('rgl', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
  writeLines("\n :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...")

  library(rgl)
  writeLines("\n :: Library rgl loaded...")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Install new package: rgl ...
:
:  :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...
:
:  :: Library rgl loaded...

Now we can use the ~rglplot~ function:

#+CAPTION:  Facebook friendship graph v6
#+NAME:     fig:FBFriendshipGraph06
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/FBFriendSGraphRGLPlot.png]]

*** Question

What parameter to the ~plot()~ function would we use to change the edge
width when plotting ~g~?

**** Answer

~edge.width~ is the parameter to control the width of the edges.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="FBFriendshipGraph07" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  plot(g, vertex.label = NA, edge.width = 3)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION:  Facebook friendship graph v7
#+NAME:     fig:FBFriendshipGraph07
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement: [H]
[[../graphs/FBFriendshipGraph07.png]]

*Explanation*

The three functions to plot the ~igraph~ are ~plot.igraph~ (the function
we used through the command ~plot~), ~tkplot~, and ~rglplot~. ~rglplot~
makes 3D plots -- you can try one with

~rglplot(g, vertex.label=NA)~

Once you've made the plot, you can click and drag to rotate the
graph. To use this function, you will need to install and load the
~rgl~ package.

To change the edge width, you need to change the edge parameter called
~width~. From ~?igraph.plotting~, we read that we need to append the
prefix ~edge~. to the beginning for our call to plot, so the full
parameter is called ~edge.width~. For instance, we could plot with
edge width 2 with the command

~plot(g, edge.width=2, vertex.label=NA)~.
