Homework week 1 part 1. An analytical detective.
#+END_ABSTRACT

* An analytical detective

Crime is an international concern, but it is documented and handled in
very different ways in different countries. In the United States,
violent crimes and property crimes are recorded by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI).  Additionally, each city documents crime, and
some cities release data regarding crime rates. The city of Chicago,
Illinois releases crime data from 2001 onward [[https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2][online]].

Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States, with a
population of over 2.7 million people. The city of Chicago is shown in
the map below, with the state of Illinois highlighted in red.

[[../graphs/ChicagoMap.png]]

There are two main types of crimes: violent crimes, and property
crimes. In this problem, we'll focus on one specific type of property
crime, called "motor vehicle theft" (sometimes referred to as grand
theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a
car. In this problem, we'll use some basic data analysis in R to
understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago.

Please download the file [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/mvtWeek1.csv][mvtWeek1.csv]] for this problem (do not open
this file in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem
because it might change the format of the Date field). Here is a list
of descriptions of the variables:

- *ID*: a unique identifier for each observation
- *Date*: the date the crime occurred
- *LocationDescription*: the location where the crime occurred
- *Arrest*: whether or not an arrest was made for the crime (TRUE if an
  arrest was made, and FALSE if an arrest was not made)
- *Domestic*: whether or not the crime was a domestic crime, meaning
  that it was committed against a family member (TRUE if it was
  domestic, and FALSE if it was not domestic)
- *Beat*: the area, or "beat" in which the crime occurred. This is the
  smallest regional division defined by the Chicago police
  department.
- *District*: the police district in which the crime occured. Each
  district is composed of many beats, and are defined by the Chicago
  Police Department.
- *CommunityArea*: the community area in which the crime occurred. Since
  the 1920s, Chicago has been divided into what are called "community
  areas", of which there are now 77. The community areas were devised
  in an attempt to create socially homogeneous regions.
- *Year*: the year in which the crime occurred.
- *Latitude*: the latitude of the location at which the crime occurred.
- *Longitude*: the longitude of the location at which the crime
  occurred.

** Problem 1.1 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

Read the dataset mvtWeek1.csv into R, using the read.csv function, and
call the data frame "mvt". Remember to navigate to the directory on
your computer containing the file mvtWeek1.csv first. It may take a
few minutes to read in the data, since it is pretty large. Then, use
the str and summary functions to answer the following questions.

How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset?

*** Download the data sets

** Problem 1.3 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

Using the "max" function, what is the maximum value of the variable
"ID"?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  maxID <- mvt[which.max(mvt$ID), ]
  maxID$ID
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 9181151

*** Answer

*9181151*

** Problem 1.4 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

What is the minimum value of the variable "Beat"?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  minBeat <- mvt[which.min(mvt$Beat), ]
  minBeat$Beat
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 111

*** Answer

*111*

** Problem 1.5 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is
the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  TArrest <- subset(mvt, Arrest == TRUE)
  nrow(TArrest)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  nrow(subset(mvt, LocationDescription == "ALLEY"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 2308

*** Answer

*2308*

** Problem 2.1 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

In many datasets, like this one, you have a date field. Unfortunately,
R does not automatically recognize entries that look like dates. We
need to use a function in R to extract the date and time. Take a look
at the first entry of Date (remember to use square brackets when
looking at a certain entry of a variable).

In what format are the entries in the variable Date?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  head(mvt$Date, 1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 12/31/12 23:15
: 131680 Levels: 1/1/01 0:01 1/1/01 0:05 1/1/01 0:30 1/1/01 10:00 ... 9/9/12 9:50

*** Answer

If you type mvt$Date[1] in your R console, you can see that the first
entry is 12/31/12 23:15. This must be in the format Month/Day/Year
Hour:Minute.

** Problem 2.2 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

Now, let's convert these characters into a Date object in R. In your R
console, type

DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))

This converts the variable "Date" into a Date object in R. Take a look
at the variable DateConvert using the summary function.

What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset? Enter
your answer as "Month Year", without the quotes. (Ex: if the answer
was 2008-03-28, you would give the answer "March 2008", without the
quotes.)

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  DateConvert <- as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
  class(DateConvert)

  summary(DateConvert)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "Date"
:         Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max.
: "2001-01-01" "2003-07-10" "2006-05-21" "2006-08-23" "2009-10-24" "2012-12-31"

*** Answer

The median date is *May 2006*

** Problem 2.3 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

Now, let's extract the month and the day of the week, and add these
variables to our data frame mvt. We can do this with two simple
functions. Type the following commands in R:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  mvt$Month = months(DateConvert)
  mvt$Weekday = weekdays(DateConvert)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This creates two new variables in our data frame, Month and Weekday,
and sets them equal to the month and weekday values that we can
extract from the Date object. Lastly, replace the old Date variable
with DateConvert by typing:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  mvt$Date = DateConvert
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Using the table command, answer the following questions.

In which month did the fewest motor vehicle thefts occur?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  head(mvt, 3)
  table(mvt$Month)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

** Problem 2.5 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

Each observation in the dataset represents a motor vehicle theft, and
the Arrest variable indicates whether an arrest was later made for
this theft. Which month has the largest number of motor vehicle thefts
for which an arrest was made?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  table(mvt$Month, mvt$Arrest)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

            FALSE  TRUE
  April     14028  1252
  August    15243  1329
  December  15029  1397
  February  12273  1238
  January   14612  1435

  March     14460  1298
  May       14848  1187
  November  14807  1256
  October   15744  1342
  September 14812  1248
#+end_example

*** Answer

If you type table(mvt$Arrest,mvt$Month), you can see that the largest
number of observations with Arrest=TRUE occurs in the month of
*January*.

** Problem 3.1 - Visualizing Crime Trends (3 points possible)

Now, let's make some plots to help us better understand how crime has
changed over time in Chicago. Throughout this problem, and in general,
you can save your plot to a file. For more information, [[http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/saving.html][this website]]
very clearly explains the process.

First, let's make a histogram of the variable *Date*. We'll add an extra
argument, to specify the number of bars we want in our histogram. In
your R console, type

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="MVTDate" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  hist(mvt$Date, breaks=100)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

[[../graphs/MVTDate.png]]

Looking at the histogram, answer the following questions.

*** In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2002 - 2012?

**** Answer

*Decreases Decreases - correct*

*** In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2005 - 2008?

**** Answer

*Decreases Decreases - correct*

*** In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2009 - 2011?

*** Answer

*Increases Increases - correct*

** Problem 3.2 - Visualizing Crime Trends (1 point possible)

Now, let's see how arrests have changed over time. Create a boxplot of
the variable "Date", sorted by the variable "Arrest" (if you are not
familiar with boxplots and would like to learn more, check out this
tutorial). In a boxplot, the bold horizontal line is the median value
of the data, the box shows the range of values between the first
quartile and third quartile, and the whiskers (the dotted lines
extending outside the box) show the minimum and maximum values,
excluding any outliers (which are plotted as circles). Outliers are
defined by first computing the difference between the first and third
quartile values, or the height of the box. This number is called the
Inter-Quartile Range (IQR). Any point that is greater than the third
quartile plus the IQR or less than the first quartile minus the IQR is
considered an outlier.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="BPDate" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  boxplot(mvt$Date ~ mvt$Arrest, xlab = "", ylab = "Date", main =
                  "Thefts dates in Chicago by Arrest")
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

[[../graphs/BPDate.png]]

Does it look like there were more crimes for which arrests were made
in the first half of the time period or the second half of the time
period? (Note that the time period is from 2001 to 2012, so the middle
of the time period is the beginning of 2007.)

*** Answer

*First half*.

You can create the boxplot with the command boxplot(mvt$Date ~
mvt$Arrest). If you look at the boxplot, the one for Arrest=TRUE is
definitely skewed towards the bottom of the plot, meaning that there
were more crimes for which arrests were made in the first half of the
time period.

** Problem 3.3 - Visualizing Crime Trends (2 points possible)

Let's investigate this further. Use the table function for the next
few questions.

For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2001 was an arrest
made?

Note: in this question and many others in the course, we are asking
for an answer as a proportion. Therefore, your answer should take a
value between 0 and 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  library(lubridate)
  mvt$Year <- year(mvt$Date)
  table(mvt$Year, mvt$Arrest)

  writeLines("\n        Proportion of vehicle thefts in 2001:")
  print(2152 / (2152 + 18517))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

       FALSE  TRUE
  2001 18517  2152
  2002 16638  2115
  2003 14859  1798
  2004 15169  1693
  2005 14956  1528
  2006 14796  1302
  2007 13068  1212
  2008 13425  1020
  2009 11327   840
  2010 14796   701
  2011 15012   625
  2012 13542   550

        Proportion of vehicle thefts in 2001:
[1] 0.1041173
#+end_example

*** Answer

If you create a table using the command table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year),
the column for 2001 has 2152 observations with Arrest=TRUE and 18517
observations with Arrest=FALSE. The fraction of motor vehicle thefts
in 2001 for which an arrest was made is thus

*2152/(2152+18517) = 0.1041173*.

** Problem 3.4 - Visualizing Crime Trends (1 point possible)

For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2007 was an arrest
made?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  library(lubridate)

  table(mvt$Year, mvt$Arrest)

  writeLines("\n        Proportion of vehicle thefts in 2007:")
  print(1212 / (13068 + 1212))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

       FALSE  TRUE

#+end_example

*** Answer

If you create a table using the command table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year),
the column for 2007 has 1212 observations with Arrest=TRUE and 13068
observations with Arrest=FALSE. The fraction of motor vehicle thefts
in 2007 for which an arrest was made is thus

 *1212/(1212+13068) = 0.08487395*.

#+end_example

Since there may still be open investigations for recent crimes, this
could explain the trend we are seeing in the data. There could also be
other factors at play, and this trend should be investigated
further. However, since we don't know when the arrests were actually
made, our detective work in this area has reached a dead end.

*** Answer

If you create a table using the command table(mvt$Arrest, mvt$Year),
the column for 2012 has 550 observations with Arrest=TRUE and 13542
observations with Arrest=FALSE. The fraction of motor vehicle thefts
in 2012 for which an arrest was made is thus

*550/(550+13542) = 0.03902924*.

** Problem 4.1 - Popular Locations (1 point possible)

Analyzing this data could be useful to the Chicago Police Department
when deciding where to allocate resources. If they want to increase
the number of arrests that are made for motor vehicle thefts, where
should they focus their efforts?

We want to find the top five locations where motor vehicle thefts
occur. If you create a table of the LocationDescription variable, it
is unfortunately very hard to read since there are 78 different
locations in the data set. By using the sort function, we can view
this same table, but sorted by the number of observations in each
category. In your R console, type:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  head(sort(table(mvt$LocationDescription), decreasing = TRUE), 6)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:
:                         STREET PARKING LOT/GARAGE(NON.RESID.)
:                         156564                          14852
:                          OTHER                          ALLEY
:                           4573                           2308

:                           2111                           1675

Which locations are the top five locations for motor vehicle thefts,
excluding the "Other" category? You should select 5 of the following
options.

*** Answer

If you type sort(table(mvt$LocationDescription)), the locations with
the largest number of motor vehicle thefts are listed last. These are
Street, Parking Lot/Garage (Non. Resid.), Alley, Gas Station, and
Driveway - Residential.

** Problem 4.2 - Popular Locations (1 point possible)

Create a subset of your data, only taking observations for which the
theft happened in one of these five locations, and call this new data
set "Top5". To do this, you can use the | symbol. In lecture, we used
the & symbol to use two criteria to make a subset of the data. To only
take observations that have a certain value in one variable or the
other, the | character can be used in place of the & symbol. This is
also called a logical "or" operation.

Alternately, you could create five different subsets, and then merge
them together into one data frame using rbind.

How many observations are in Top5?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  Top5 <- subset(mvt, LocationDescription == "STREET" |
                      LocationDescription == "PARKING LOT/GARAGE(NON.RESID.)" |
                      LocationDescription == "ALLEY" |
                      LocationDescription == "GAS STATION" |
                      LocationDescription == "DRIVEWAY - RESIDENTIAL")
  head(Top5, 5)
  writeLines("        The number of observations in Top5 are:")
  print(nrow(Top5))

The procedure above is OK. We can do this in other way?

Another way of doing this would be to use the %in% operator in R. This
operator checks for inclusion in a set. You can create the same subset
by typing the following two lines in your R console:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  TopLocations <- c("STREET", "PARKING LOT/GARAGE(NON.RESID.)", "ALLEY",
                   "GAS STATION", "DRIVEWAY - RESIDENTIAL")
  Top5 <- subset(mvt, LocationDescription %in% TopLocations)
  head(Top5, 5)
  writeLines("        The number of observations in Top5 are:")
  print(nrow(Top5))

** Problem 4.3 - Popular Locations (2 points possible)

R will remember the other categories of the *LocationDescription*
variable from the original dataset, so running
*table(Top5$LocationDescription)* will have a lot of unnecessary
output. To make our tables a bit nicer to read, we can refresh this
factor variable. In your R console, type:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  Top5$LocationDescription <- factor(Top5$LocationDescription)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

If you run the str or table function on Top5 now, you should see that
LocationDescription now only has 5 values, as we expect.

*** Answer

If you create a table of LocationDescription compared to Arrest,
table(Top5$LocationDescription, Top5$Arrest), you can then compute the
fraction of motor vehicle thefts that resulted in arrests at each
location. *Gas Station* has by far the highest percentage of arrests,
with over 20% of motor vehicle thefts resulting in an arrest.
