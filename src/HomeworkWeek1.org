#+END_ABSTRACT

* An analytical detective

Crime is an international concern, but it is documented and handled in
very different ways in different countries. In the United States,
violent crimes and property crimes are recorded by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI).  Additionally, each city documents crime, and
some cities release data regarding crime rates. The city of Chicago,
Illinois releases crime data from 2001 onward [[https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2][online]].

Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States, with a
population of over 2.7 million people. The city of Chicago is shown in
the map below, with the state of Illinois highlighted in red.

[[../graphs/ChicagoMap.png]]

There are two main types of crimes: violent crimes, and property
crimes. In this problem, we'll focus on one specific type of property
crime, called "motor vehicle theft" (sometimes referred to as grand
theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a
car. In this problem, we'll use some basic data analysis in R to
understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago.

Please download the file [[https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx%2B15.071x_2a%2B2T2015%2Btype@asset%2Bblock/mvtWeek1.csv][mvtWeek1.csv]] for this problem (do not open
this file in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem
because it might change the format of the Date field). Here is a list
of descriptions of the variables:

- *ID*: a unique identifier for each observation
- *Date*: the date the crime occurred
- *LocationDescription*: the location where the crime occurred
- *Arrest*: whether or not an arrest was made for the crime (TRUE if an
  arrest was made, and FALSE if an arrest was not made)
- *Domestic*: whether or not the crime was a domestic crime, meaning
  that it was committed against a family member (TRUE if it was
  domestic, and FALSE if it was not domestic)
- *Beat*: the area, or "beat" in which the crime occurred. This is the
  smallest regional division defined by the Chicago police
  department.
- *District*: the police district in which the crime occured. Each
  district is composed of many beats, and are defined by the Chicago
  Police Department.
- *CommunityArea*: the community area in which the crime occurred. Since
  the 1920s, Chicago has been divided into what are called "community
  areas", of which there are now 77. The community areas were devised
  in an attempt to create socially homogeneous regions.
- *Year*: the year in which the crime occurred.
- *Latitude*: the latitude of the location at which the crime occurred.
- *Longitude*: the longitude of the location at which the crime
  occurred.

** Problem 1.1 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

Read the dataset mvtWeek1.csv into R, using the read.csv function, and
call the data frame "mvt". Remember to navigate to the directory on
your computer containing the file mvtWeek1.csv first. It may take a
few minutes to read in the data, since it is pretty large. Then, use
the str and summary functions to answer the following questions.

How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset?

*** Download the data sets

In this part we can download the data

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  rm(list = ls())                         # Remove all workspace data
  library(parallel)

  if(!file.exists("../data")) {
          dir.create("../data")
  }

  fileUrl <-

  fileName <- "mvtWeek1.csv"

  dataPath <- "../data"
  filePath <- paste(dataPath, fileName, sep = "/")

  if(!file.exists(filePath)) {
          download.file(fileUrl, destfile = filePath, method = "curl")

**  Problem 1.2 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

How many variables are in this dataset?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("    Dimension of the dataframe")
  dim(mvt)

  writeLines("    Names of the dataframe")
  names(mvt)

  writeLines("    Any NA in the dataframe")
  anyNA(mvt)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: [10] "Latitude"            "Longitude"
:     Any NA in the dataframe
: [1] TRUE

** Problem 1.3 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

Using the "max" function, what is the maximum value of the variable
"ID"?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  maxID <- mvt[which.max(mvt$ID), ]
  maxID$ID
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 9181151

** Problem 1.4 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

What is the minimum value of the variable "Beat"?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  minBeat <- mvt[which.min(mvt$Beat), ]
  minBeat$Beat
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 111

** Problem 1.5 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is
the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  TArrest <- subset(mvt, Arrest == TRUE)
  nrow(TArrest)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 15536

** Problem 1.6 - Loading the Data (1 point possible)

How many observations have a LocationDescription value of ALLEY?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  nrow(subset(mvt, LocationDescription == "ALLEY"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 2308

** Problem 2.1 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

In many datasets, like this one, you have a date field. Unfortunately,
R does not automatically recognize entries that look like dates. We
need to use a function in R to extract the date and time. Take a look
at the first entry of Date (remember to use square brackets when
looking at a certain entry of a variable).

In what format are the entries in the variable Date?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  head(mvt$Date, 1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 12/31/12 23:15
: 131680 Levels: 1/1/01 0:01 1/1/01 0:05 1/1/01 0:30 1/1/01 10:00 ... 9/9/12 9:50

** Problem 2.2 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

Now, let's convert these characters into a Date object in R. In your R
console, type

DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))

This converts the variable "Date" into a Date object in R. Take a look
at the variable DateConvert using the summary function.

What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset? Enter
your answer as "Month Year", without the quotes. (Ex: if the answer
was 2008-03-28, you would give the answer "March 2008", without the
quotes.)

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  DateConvert <- as.Date(strptime(mvt$Date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
  class(DateConvert)

  summary(DateConvert)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "Date"
:         Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max.
: "2001-01-01" "2003-07-10" "2006-05-21" "2006-08-23" "2009-10-24" "2012-12-31"

** Problem 2.3 - Understanding Dates in R (1 point possible)

Now, let's extract the month and the day of the week, and add these
variables to our data frame mvt. We can do this with two simple
functions. Type the following commands in R:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  mvt$Month = months(DateConvert)
  mvt$Weekday = weekdays(DateConvert)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This creates two new variables in our data frame, Month and Weekday,
and sets them equal to the month and weekday values that we can
extract from the Date object. Lastly, replace the old Date variable
with DateConvert by typing:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  mvt$Date = DateConvert
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Using the table command, answer the following questions.

In which month did the fewest motor vehicle thefts occur?

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output :exports all
  head(mvt, 3)
  table(mvt$Month)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

** Problem 3.1 - Visualizing Crime Trends (3 points possible)

Now, let's make some plots to help us better understand how crime has
changed over time in Chicago. Throughout this problem, and in general,
you can save your plot to a file. For more information, [[http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/saving.html][this website]]
very clearly explains the process.

First, let's make a histogram of the variable *Date*. We'll add an extra
argument, to specify the number of bars we want in our histogram. In
your R console, type

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="MVTDate" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  hist(mvt$Date, breaks=100)
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

[[../graphs/MVTDate.png]]

Looking at the histogram, answer the following questions.

In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2002 -
2012?

*Decreases Decreases - correct*

In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2005 - 2008?

*Decreases Decreases - correct*

In general, does it look like crime increases or decreases from 2009 -
2011?

*Increases Increases - correct*

** Problem 3.2 - Visualizing Crime Trends (1 point possible)

Now, let's see how arrests have changed over time. Create a boxplot of
the variable "Date", sorted by the variable "Arrest" (if you are not
familiar with boxplots and would like to learn more, check out this
tutorial). In a boxplot, the bold horizontal line is the median value
of the data, the box shows the range of values between the first
quartile and third quartile, and the whiskers (the dotted lines
extending outside the box) show the minimum and maximum values,
excluding any outliers (which are plotted as circles). Outliers are
defined by first computing the difference between the first and third
quartile values, or the height of the box. This number is called the
Inter-Quartile Range (IQR). Any point that is greater than the third
quartile plus the IQR or less than the first quartile minus the IQR is
considered an outlier.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var basename="BPDate" :session :results none silent :exports none
  filename <- paste("../graphs/", basename, ".png", sep = "")

  png(filename = filename, bg = "white", width = 640, height = 480, units = "px")

  ## ----- Plot code begin here
  boxplot(mvt$Date ~ mvt$Arrest, xlab = "", ylab = "Date", main =
                  "Thefts dates in Chicago by Arrest")
  ## ----- Plot code ends here

  ## Close the PNG device and plots
  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

[[../graphs/BPDate.png]]

Does it look like there were more crimes for which arrests were made
in the first half of the time period or the second half of the time
period? (Note that the time period is from 2001 to 2012, so the middle
of the time period is the beginning of 2007.)

** Problem 3.3 - Visualizing Crime Trends (2 points possible)

Let's investigate this further. Use the table function for the next
few questions.

For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2001 was an arrest
made?

Note: in this question and many others in the course, we are asking
for an answer as a proportion. Therefore, your answer should take a
value between 0 and 1.
