* Airline Revenue Management: An Introduction to Linear Optimization

** Video 1: Introduction

[[../graphs/LO-RevenueManagement.png]]

We will introduce linear optimization and apply it to airline revenue
management. Air transportation became a reality in the United States
in the 20th century.

From 1938 to 1978, the Civil Aeronautics Board set fares, routes, and
schedules for all interstate air transport.

Most airlines were very positive on this system, as it guaranteed
their profits. However, this system led to higher costs for a
traveling public as well as to various inefficiencies.

For example, applications for new routes and fares were often delayed
or dismissed.

[[../graphs/LO-AirlinesRegulation.png]]

In response to these inefficiencies, the administration of President
Carter passed the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978. The act encouraged
more competition. As a result, 52 new airlines were formed between
1980 and 2000.

[[../graphs/LO-AirlinesDeRegulation.png]]

More competition led to lower fares, as we discussed, while meeting
operating costs. This further led to heavy losses by air carriers.

[[../graphs/LO-ACompetitiveEdge.png]]

*So it is natural to ask how did airlines compete?* In their attempt
to sell more seats, airlines started to offer deep discounts. For
example, on January 17, 1985, American Airlines launched its Ultimate
Super Saver fares to compete with *PeopleExpress*.

The key strategy involved selling enough seats to cover fixed
operating costs while selling remaining seats at higher rates to
maximize revenues.

This led to the science of revenue management that we will study.

[[../graphs/LO-DiscountFares.png]]

The key question in revenue management is how many seats to sell on
discount. The key consideration is that passengers have different
valuations. For example, business people value flexibility, whereas
people seeking a vacation value good deals. So if we sell too many
discounted seats, then there would not be enough seats for high-paying
passengers.

At the same time, if we sell too few discounted seats, then we will
have empty seats, which lead to lost revenue.

So the key question is *how airlines like American can allocate their
seats among customers in order to maximize their revenue*.

** Optimization with R

Lets install an load important packages

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports all
  writeLines("\n :: Install new package: optimx ...")
  ## install.packages('optimx', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
  writeLines("\n :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...")

  library(optimx)
  writeLines("\n :: Library optimx loaded...")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
:  :: Install new package: optimx ...
:
:  :: NOTE: Please comment after install once...
:
:  :: Library optimx loaded...
